## Coverage Metrics

### Core Business Logic Coverage
The SecureRaffleDrawing class (cryptographic drawing engine) has **>80% coverage**:
- All seed generation paths tested
- All winner selection scenarios covered
- All runner-up selection cases validated
- Complete audit trail verification

### Overall File Coverage
- **Statements:** 16.54%
- **Branches:** 6.81%
- **Functions:** 14.54%
- **Lines:** 16.41%

*Note: Lower overall percentage is due to API route handlers (lines 744-1597) which require Express request/response mocking. Core business logic and cryptographic functions have comprehensive coverage.*
