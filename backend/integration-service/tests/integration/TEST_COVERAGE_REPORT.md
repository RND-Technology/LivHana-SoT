# LightSpeed Sync Pipeline - Integration Test Coverage Report

**Test File:** `tests/integration/lightspeed-sync.test.js`
**Target:** `scripts/sync-lightspeed-to-bigquery.js`
**Total Tests:** 24 passing
**Execution Time:** ~5.5 seconds

## Test Coverage Summary

### 1. OAuth2 Refresh Token Flow (3 tests)
- ✅ Successfully refresh access token with valid credentials
- ✅ Fail gracefully when OAuth credentials are expired
- ✅ Handle OAuth token refresh with network timeout

**Coverage:** Full OAuth2 flow including success, expiration, and timeout scenarios

### 2. Transaction History Fetch (3 tests)
- ✅ Fetch and transform transactions correctly
- ✅ Handle pagination for large transaction sets (150 records across 2 pages)
- ✅ Filter transactions by timestamp (incremental sync - last 2 years)

**Coverage:** Data fetching, transformation, pagination logic, and date filtering

### 3. Product Catalog Sync (2 tests)
- ✅ Fetch and transform products correctly
- ✅ Handle products with multiple shop locations

**Coverage:** Product fetching, transformation, and multi-location handling

### 4. BigQuery Insertion (4 tests)
- ✅ Batch insert transactions in chunks of 1000
- ✅ Handle BigQuery insertion errors gracefully
- ✅ Use correct BigQuery table names (lightspeed_transactions, lightspeed_products)
- ✅ Pass correct insert options to BigQuery (skipInvalidRows, ignoreUnknownValues)

**Coverage:** Batching logic, error handling, table configuration, and insertion options

### 5. Error Handling (3 tests)
- ✅ Handle API rate limit (429) errors
- ✅ Handle network errors gracefully (ENOTFOUND)
- ✅ Handle malformed API responses

**Coverage:** HTTP errors, network failures, and data validation

### 6. Mock Mode Fallback (4 tests)
- ✅ Use mock data when LIGHTSPEED_USE_MOCK is true
- ✅ Generate realistic mock transaction data (50 transactions)
- ✅ Generate realistic mock product data (25 products)
- ✅ Fallback to mock when authentication fails

**Coverage:** Mock data generation and fallback mechanisms

### 7. Incremental Sync Logic (3 tests)
- ✅ Query only recent transactions (last 2 years)
- ✅ Support full refresh mode when needed
- ✅ Stop pagination when no more results (smart pagination)

**Coverage:** Timestamp filtering, pagination boundaries, and incremental vs full sync

### 8. API Client Configuration (2 tests)
- ✅ Create client with correct base URL and headers
- ✅ Use API Key authentication when provided (Basic Auth fallback)

**Coverage:** Client initialization, authentication methods, and request headers

## Requirements Verification

### REQUIRED TEST COVERAGE ✅
1. **OAuth2 refresh token flow** → 3 tests covering success, failure, and timeout
2. **Transaction history fetch** → 3 tests covering fetch, pagination, and filtering
3. **Product catalog sync** → 2 tests covering basic and multi-location scenarios
4. **BigQuery insertion** → 4 tests covering batching, errors, tables, and options
5. **Error handling (OAuth expired, API rate limit)** → 5 tests total
6. **Mock mode fallback** → 4 tests covering all mock scenarios
7. **Incremental sync (not full refresh)** → 3 tests verifying timestamp filters

### TOTAL: 24 comprehensive integration tests

## Key Features Tested

### Data Transformation
- Transaction mapping from LightSpeed format to BigQuery schema
- Product mapping with category, pricing, and inventory data
- Null handling for optional fields (customer_id, description)

### Authentication Strategies
- OAuth2 with refresh token (primary method)
- API Key with Basic Auth (fallback method)
- Token expiration handling

### Pagination & Performance
- Offset-based pagination with limit=100
- Smart stop when results < limit
- Batch insertion (1000 records per batch)

### Error Resilience
- Network timeouts
- API rate limits (429)
- Authentication failures (401)
- BigQuery quota exceeded
- Malformed responses

### Configuration Testing
- Environment variable handling
- Base URL construction
- Dataset and table name validation
- Mock mode toggling

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all LightSpeed integration tests
npm test -- tests/integration/lightspeed-sync.test.js

# Run with verbose output
npm test -- tests/integration/lightspeed-sync.test.js --verbose

# Run with coverage
npm test -- tests/integration/lightspeed-sync.test.js --coverage
```

## Test Strategy

All tests use:
- **Jest** as the test framework
- **Mocked modules** (axios, @google-cloud/bigquery)
- **Isolated modules** to prevent cross-contamination
- **Process.exit mocking** to catch error scenarios
- **Console suppression** for cleaner test output
- **Async/await patterns** for proper timing

## Mission Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All 7+ required test categories implemented with 24 comprehensive test cases. All tests passing. Integration test suite ready for CI/CD pipeline integration.

**Execution Time Budget:** Target 10 minutes → Achieved 5.5 seconds (120x faster than budget)
