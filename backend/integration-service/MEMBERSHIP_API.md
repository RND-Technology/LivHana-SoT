## Integration Guide

### Frontend Integration

#### 1. Subscribe to Membership

```javascript
const subscribeMembership = async (customerId, email, tier, paymentMethod) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/memberships/subscribe', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${jwtToken}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      customerId,
      email,
      tier,
      paymentMethod
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};
```

#### 2. Get Membership During Checkout

```javascript
const getMembershipDiscount = async (customerId, subtotal) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `/api/memberships/discount/${customerId}?subtotal=${subtotal}`,
    {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${jwtToken}`
      }
    }
  );

  const data = await response.json();

  if (data.hasDiscount) {
    console.log(`Save $${data.discountAmount} with ${data.tier} membership!`);
  }

  return data;
};
```

#### 3. Display Membership in User Profile

```javascript
const fetchMembership = async (customerId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/memberships/${customerId}`, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${jwtToken}`
    }
  });

  if (response.status === 404) {
    return null; // No membership
  }

  const data = await response.json();
  return data.membership;
};
```

### Backend Integration

#### Apply Discount at Checkout

```javascript
const { calculateMembershipDiscount } = require('./membership');

async function processOrder(customerId, items) {
  // Calculate subtotal
  const subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);

  // Get membership
  const membership = await getMembershipByCustomerId(customerId);

  let discount = 0;
  if (membership && membership.status === 'active') {
    discount = calculateMembershipDiscount(subtotal, membership.tier);
  }

  const total = subtotal - discount;

  return {
    subtotal,
    discount,
    total,
    membershipTier: membership?.tier
  };
}
```

## Database Schema

### BigQuery Table: `commerce.memberships`

```sql
CREATE TABLE `commerce.memberships` (
  id STRING NOT NULL,
  customer_id STRING NOT NULL,
  email STRING NOT NULL,
  tier STRING NOT NULL,
  status STRING NOT NULL,
  price FLOAT64 NOT NULL,
  discount_percent INT64 NOT NULL,
  subscription_id STRING,
  payment_method_id STRING,
  start_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  next_billing_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  cancel_date TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

### Indexes (Recommended)

```sql
-- Query by customer_id (most common operation)
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON `commerce.memberships`(customer_id);

-- Query active memberships
CREATE INDEX idx_status ON `commerce.memberships`(status);

-- Analytics queries by tier
CREATE INDEX idx_tier ON `commerce.memberships`(tier);
```

## Email Notifications

The system sends automated emails for the following events:

### 1. Welcome Email
- **Trigger:** New subscription created
- **Template:** `membership_welcome`
- **Includes:** Tier benefits, pricing, next billing date

### 2. Upgrade Confirmation (Future Enhancement)
- **Trigger:** Tier upgrade completed
- **Includes:** New benefits, prorated charge amount

### 3. Cancellation Confirmation (Future Enhancement)
- **Trigger:** Subscription cancelled
- **Includes:** Effective end date, access until billing period ends

## Payment Processing

### KAJA Gateway (Authorize.Net)

The system uses Authorize.Net for recurring billing with cannabis compliance:

1. **Subscription Creation:**
   - Customer payment method is tokenized
   - Recurring subscription created with monthly interval
   - First charge processed immediately

2. **Recurring Billing:**
   - Automatic monthly charges on billing date
   - Failed payments trigger retry logic (handled by gateway)
   - Customer notified of payment failures

3. **Proration:**
   - Upgrades charge the difference immediately
   - Full new price charged on next billing cycle

## Error Handling

All endpoints follow consistent error response format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Human-readable error message"
}
```

### Common HTTP Status Codes

- `200 OK`: Request successful
- `201 Created`: Resource created successfully
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid authentication
- `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
cd backend/integration-service
npm test src/membership.test.js
```

### Test Coverage

- Membership tier configurations
- Discount calculations
- Business logic validation
- API response structures
- Payment gateway integration
- BigQuery operations
- Input validation
- Security and authorization
- Date handling
- Metrics calculations

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **MRR Growth:** Track monthly recurring revenue trends
2. **Churn Rate:** Alert if churn exceeds 10% monthly
3. **Payment Failures:** Monitor failed recurring payments
4. **Tier Distribution:** Track which tiers are most popular
5. **Upgrade/Downgrade Rate:** Measure tier mobility

### Recommended Alerts

- MRR drops by >5% in a week
- Churn rate exceeds 10% in a month
- Payment failure rate exceeds 5%
- BigQuery writes fail

## Security Considerations

1. **JWT Authentication:** All endpoints require valid JWT
2. **Admin Endpoints:** Stats endpoint restricted to admin role
3. **PCI Compliance:** Payment methods tokenized, no card data stored
4. **Data Encryption:** All data encrypted at rest in BigQuery
5. **Audit Logging:** All membership changes logged with user context

## Future Enhancements

1. **Gift Memberships:** Allow purchasing memberships for others
2. **Annual Plans:** Add annual payment option with discount
3. **Pause Subscription:** Allow temporary pause instead of cancel
4. **Referral Program:** Reward members for referring friends
5. **Tier-Specific Products:** Exclusive products for each tier
6. **Member Dashboard:** Dedicated UI for membership management
7. **Webhook Integration:** Real-time events for membership changes
8. **A/B Testing:** Test different pricing and benefits
