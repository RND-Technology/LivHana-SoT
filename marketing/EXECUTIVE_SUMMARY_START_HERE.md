## RISK MANAGEMENT

### What Could Go Wrong?

**Risk #1: Winners Don't Scale at Current Performance**
- **Probability:** Low-Medium
- **Impact:** Revenue increase only 30-50% vs. projected 75-162%
- **Mitigation:** Start with 20% budget increase, scale gradually, monitor frequency
- **Action if triggered:** Hold budget steady, refresh creative, expand audience slightly

**Risk #2: Ad Fatigue on Scaled Campaigns**
- **Probability:** Medium (after 2-3 weeks)
- **Impact:** ROAS drops 20-30%
- **Mitigation:** Have 3-5 variations of each winner ready to rotate
- **Action if triggered:** Pause fatigued ad, activate fresh variation immediately

**Risk #3: Budget Overspend**
- **Probability:** Low (with automated rules)
- **Impact:** Could lose $500-1,000 in a day
- **Mitigation:** Automated rule stops spend at $200/day, daily monitoring
- **Action if triggered:** Pause all campaigns, investigate, restart with lower budgets

## FAQ - QUICK ANSWERS

**Q: I can't find 22 ads to pause. Is that okay?**
A: Yes! Pause whatever meets the criteria. Even 10-15 ads = $1,000-1,500 saved.

**Q: What if my Purple Theme ads are already at $1,200/month?**
A: Great! Reallocate that budget to Orange Character or testing new variations.

**Q: How do I identify "Purple Theme" vs "Orange Character" ads?**
A: Look at the ad thumbnail/creative in Meta Ads Manager:

- Orange Character = features your HNC character (orange colored character)
- Red/Orange = blend of red and orange colors

**Q: Should I pause ads gradually or all at once?**
A: ALL AT ONCE. Every day they run costs you $76.50. No reason to delay.

A: Scale proportionally with what you have:
- 32% to Purple Theme
