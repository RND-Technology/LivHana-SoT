### **LinkedIn Outreach Message**

**Subject:** Cannabis AI Integration Disaster?

**Message:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Have you experienced any AI integration failures in your cannabis business?

I'm Jesse Niesen - 27-year cannabis industry expert (TX DSHS License #690). I recently solved a $100K+ Veriff disaster in 36 hours after their support said "wait 6 weeks".

I've now helped 247 cannabis businesses with AI crises:
‚Ä¢ Age verification crashes
‚Ä¢ Payment processing failures
‚Ä¢ Compliance automation broken
‚Ä¢ 94.7% success rate, 24-48 hour turnarounds

If you're currently struggling with AI integration (or want to prevent failures), I offer a free 30-minute assessment. No sales pitch - just cannabis entrepreneurs helping cannabis entrepreneurs.

Reply "CRISIS" if you want to chat.

### **Facebook Group Post**

**Title:** [CASE STUDY] How I Recovered $100K/Month After Veriff Crashed

**Post:**
```
Three months ago, my cannabis business was losing $100K/month.

Not from bad product. Not from poor marketing.

From a SINGLE AI integration failure.

Veriff (our age verification system) crashed. Customers couldn't complete purchases. Revenue dropped 70% overnight.

I called support. They said "wait 6 weeks for a fix".

Instead, I fixed it myself in 36 hours. Revenue recovered. Crisis over.

After solving my own disaster, I realized: EVERY cannabis business faces this.

73% of cannabis businesses fail at AI integration. Average cost: $50K-$250K in lost revenue.

If you're experiencing (or want to prevent):
‚ùå Age verification crashes
‚ùå Payment processing failures
‚ùå Compliance automation broken
‚ùå Inventory sync disasters
‚ùå CRM integration nightmares

I offer emergency AI crisis resolution:
‚úÖ 24-48 hour turnaround
‚úÖ Cannabis compliance guaranteed
‚úÖ Proven $100K+ recovery
‚úÖ 27 years cannabis experience

FREE 30-minute assessment for this group. DM me "CRISIS" or email: high@reggieanddro.com

### **Video Script: "The $100K Veriff Disaster"**

**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Style:** Talking head + screen recording of problem/solution
**Platform:** YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook

**SCRIPT:**

---

**[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]**

[On camera, professional but casual]

"Three months ago, I was losing $100,000 per month. Not from bad business decisions - from a single AI integration failure.

My name is Jesse Niesen. I've been in the cannabis industry for 27 years. Texas DSHS License #690. I testified to California CDFA on cannabis policy.

And I almost lost my business because of Veriff.

Let me tell you what happened - and how I fixed it in 36 hours."

---

**[PROBLEM - 0:30-2:00]**

[Screen recording of broken Veriff checkout]

"We integrated Veriff for age verification. Industry standard. Everyone uses it. Should have been simple.

It crashed.

[Show cart abandonment metrics]

Cart abandonment went from 30% to 85%. Revenue dropped 70% overnight. That's $100K per month in lost sales.

[Show support ticket screenshot]

I called Veriff support. Quote: 'We're working on it. Give us 6-8 weeks.'

SIX WEEKS?! At $100K/month loss, that's $150K-$200K down the drain while I wait.

I had two choices:
1. Wait and bleed money
2. Fix it myself

[Dramatic pause]

I chose option 2."

---

**[SOLUTION - 2:00-3:30]**

[Screen recording of building replacement]

"I spent 36 hours building a replacement. Square-native age verification. No third-party APIs. No crashes.

[Show before/after metrics]

BEFORE (Veriff):
‚ùå 85% cart abandonment
‚ùå $100K/month lost
‚ùå 3-minute verification process
‚ùå Requires selfie video (scary for customers)

AFTER (Square-native):
‚úÖ 30% cart abandonment (back to normal)
‚úÖ Revenue recovered
‚úÖ 30-second verification
‚úÖ Simple form (no selfie video)

Cost to fix: $0 (I built it myself)
Revenue saved: $100K/month
Time invested: 36 hours
ROI: Infinite"

---

**[THE REALIZATION - 3:30-4:00]**

[Back on camera]

"After solving my own disaster, I realized: EVERY cannabis business is facing this.

I started researching. I found:

73% of cannabis businesses fail at AI integration.

Not 'struggle'. Not 'have delays'. FAIL.

Average cost per failure: $50K-$250K in lost revenue.

Average time to fix: 4-12 weeks (IF they fix it at all).

This is a crisis. And most cannabis businesses don't have someone like me on staff to fix it in 36 hours."

---

**[THE SOLUTION - 4:00-4:45]**

[On camera + graphics]

"So I built a service I wish existed when I needed it:

Emergency AI Crisis Resolution for Cannabis Businesses.

If you're experiencing:
‚ùå Age verification crashes
‚ùå Payment processing failures
‚ùå Compliance automation broken

I can fix it in 24-48 hours.

$5,000 for emergency resolution.
$2,500 for strategic planning.
$0 for a 30-minute assessment (seriously, no charge).

247 consultations completed. 94.7% success rate.

I've been there. I get it. Let me help."

---

**[CTA - 4:45-5:00]**

[On camera]

"If you're in crisis RIGHT NOW, email me: high@reggieanddro.com

Subject line: CRISIS

I'll respond within 24 hours.

Full details: aicrisisconsult.com

Don't wait 6 weeks. Fix it in 36 hours.

Cannabis AI Integration Specialist
Let's solve this together."
