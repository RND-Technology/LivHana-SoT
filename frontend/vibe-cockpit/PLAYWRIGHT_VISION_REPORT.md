## 🎯 TIER-1 ASSESSMENT

### WHAT'S PIMP AF:
1. **Empire Dashboard** - 100% functional, beautiful design
2. **Square Cockpit** - Honest status reporting, professional UI
3. **Navigation** - Clean, intuitive, all links work
4. **Branding** - Consistent Reggie & Dro / LivHana theme
5. **Status Indicators** - Real-time, accurate

### CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED:
1. **Products Page** - Fix age verification to display products
2. **Square Data Integration** - Connect frontend to backend catalog
3. **Voice Mode** - Remove auto-popup behavior
4. **BigQuery Live Mode** - Connect real credentials for $892K actual data

### BREAKTHROUGH NEEDED:
Connect the **REAL Square products** from backend to the **Products page frontend**. Backend confirmed has data, just need the age gate to actually work and trigger product load.
