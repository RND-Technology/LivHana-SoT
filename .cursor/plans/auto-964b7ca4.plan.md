# Session Synthesis & Comprehensive Problem-Solving Report

### Scope
- Review full chat history to consolidate all solved problems
- Summarize RAW file forensics, boot fixes, RPM changes, and fallacy purges
- Generate recommendations for sustaining voice-first Tier‑1 boot
- Prepare handoff notes for next session (enable zero-configuration restart)

### Sections
1) **Accomplishments (this session)**
   - RPM ingestion + Evergreen stack + frontend RpmPanel JWT wiring
   - Backend fixes (param mismatch, exports lifecycle migration, docs)
   - Atomic writes for agents; ExecMon alignment
   - Secret scrubbing (perl → BSD sed); 1Password scoped to --account
   - Context cleanup (85K → 11.6K files); .contextignore added
   - Fallacy purges ([PURGED_FALLACY] status, PACT Act, OAuth endpoints, Lightspeed R-Series)
   - REG‑5 Linear issue opened for Alice DNS
   - Boot fixes (voice-first, sequential agents, integration-service decoupled, crash-recovery polling, memory/context guards, raw-mode guard, timeout portability)

2) **RAW Files Forensics**
   - Inventory: where they appear (1.rnd, .emergency-archive, out/out_mirror, tmp)
   - Causes: automatic backups, copy loops, snapshot scripts
   - Impacts: context bloat (agent crashes), Cursor indexing overhead (CPU/RAM), disk/IO pressure (delays voice-mode spawn)
   - Prevention: ignore rules, boot preflight guard, optional Spotlight exclusions
   - Consolidation: extract/dedupe valuable content → docs/raw/RAW_CONSOLIDATED.md

3) **Voice-First Boot Stability**
   - Current behavior: STT/TTS must be healthy for voice; degrades to text-only otherwise
   - Fixes implemented: voice-first init, sequential agent start, wait_for_service, STRICT_VOICE gate, crash-recovery loop, atomic status writes, memory/context guards, raw-mode guard, LaunchAgents + watchdog plan (optional)
   - Health checks: tmux sessions, STT/TTS ports, integration /health
   - Next steps: install LaunchAgents for STT/TTS to guarantee availability

4) **RPM & Alice Expansion**
   - Full Funnel RPM plan (Oct 26–Nov 2): local delivery (Favor/Uber/DD), Leafly sync, Auto-[PURGED_FALLACY], nurture, membership, loyalty, dashboard
   - Alice DNS fix (REG‑5): Andrew's checklist
   - Leafly unlock tomorrow
   - Fallacy corrections: [PURGED_FALLACY] operational; OAuth R-Series endpoints

5) **Recommendations**
   - Enable LaunchAgents for voice services (always-on)
   - Add SUPPRESS_OPTIONAL_WARNINGS=1 to boot for zero warnings
   - Enforce .contextignore for Cursor indexing limits
   - Archive/remove old RAW cruft regularly
   - Update SESSION_PROGRESS.md after each major milestone

6) **Next Session Handoff**
   - Repo state (branch, outstanding commits, known blockers)
   - Command to run: single-line boot command with gates
   - Voice attach: `bin/liv-attach` (respawn if missing)
   - Verification: run health snapshot, confirm 5/5 agents + voice

### Format
- A clean markdown document saved to `docs/SESSION_SYNTHESIS_YYYYMMDD.md`
- Includes section links, inline code references, concise bullets

### Acceptance
- All accomplishments listed with evidence (commit SHAs, file paths)
- RAW forensics findings clear
- Recommendations actionable
- Handoff concise and reproducible

### Notes
- No new edits; purely synthesis and documentation
- Final check: validate state is consistent and ready for clean restart


### To-dos

- [ ] Enumerate all completed work with evidence (commits, files, test results)
