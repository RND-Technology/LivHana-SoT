# ðŸ§ª TESTING & CI/CD RULES

## ðŸŽ¯ TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- **Unit Tests**: Required for ALL services (minimum 80% coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: Required for service boundaries
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright MCP for critical user flows
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for API endpoints
- **Security Tests**: OWASP compliance checks

## ðŸ¤– PLAYWRIGHT MCP INTEGRATION
- Config: [automation/tests/playwright/playwright.config.ts](mdc:automation/tests/playwright/playwright.config.ts)
- Tests: [automation/tests/playwright/tests/](mdc:automation/tests/playwright/tests)
- Mocks: Use deterministic mocks for external services
- CI Integration: Run on every PR and merge

## ðŸš€ CI/CD PIPELINE
```yaml
Pipeline Stages:
1. Lint & Format (ESLint, Prettier)
2. Unit Tests (Jest/Vitest)
3. Integration Tests
4. Build Docker Images
5. Security Scan
6. Deploy to Staging
7. E2E Tests (Playwright)
8. Deploy to Production
```

## âœ… QUALITY GATES
- **NO MERGE** without:
  - Passing all tests
  - Code review approval
  - Updated documentation
  - Clean `git status`
  - Security scan pass
  - Performance benchmarks met
