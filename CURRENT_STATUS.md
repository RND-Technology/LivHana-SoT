# Current Status – LivHana-SoT

## ✅ Working
- [ ] Frontend boilerplate builds with Vite/React/Tailwind
- [ ] Cloud Shell cleanup script verified

## ❌ Broken
- [ ] Repo structure still contains legacy junk not migrated
- [ ] Multi-model orchestration not connected

## 🚧 Blocker
- [ ] Migration of old repos (liv-hana-e2e-pipeline, etc.) into LivHana-SoT required before E2E progress
