## 📋 ACTIVE ERRORS & NEW GUARANTEES

### Error #1: Claude Code Knowledge Cutoff (Oct 2024)

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Agent**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5) - [Awaiting emoji assignment]
**Error**: Operating with 12-month-old knowledge in fast-moving AI race
**Impact**: Missing critical context, potentially making stale assumptions
**Root Cause**: Training data cutoff, no automatic update mechanism
**New Guarantee**:

- Read EXTERNAL_SIGNAL_INDEX.md on EVERY boot (no exceptions)
- Flag knowledge gaps immediately when discovered
- Request current intel from Jesse before making strategic decisions
- Update working knowledge within 5 minutes of session start
**Status**: ACTIVE - System created, awaiting Jesse intel drop
**Verification**: CODEX checks file read timestamp at session start

### Error #2: File Size Violations (4 files over 500 lines)

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Agent**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Error**:

- REPLIT_UNICORN_RACE_DASHBOARD_ASSIGNMENT.md: 568 lines (68 over)
- CORE4_COMMITMENT.md: 528 lines (28 over)
- UNICORN_RACE_OPTIMAL_PATH.md: 523 lines (23 over)
- TRINITY_UNITY_PROTOCOL.md: 523 lines (23 over)
**Impact**: Slows agent access, violates Jesse's efficiency mandate
**Root Cause**: Comprehensive documentation without splitting
**New Guarantee**:
- Check file size BEFORE committing (wc -l always)
- If >500 lines, split immediately (no "will do later")
- Create index file for navigation when splitting
- Maintain <500 lines going forward (no exceptions)
**Status**: ACTIVE - Files identified, splitting needed
**Verification**: CODEX runs daily file size check

### Error #3: Replit Voice Cockpit Not Pushed to Git

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Agent**: 🦄 REPLIT (Sonnet 4.5)
**Error**: Prototype complete but not synced to shared repo
**Impact**: Blocks entire Trinity pipeline (Claude Code waiting, Cheetah waiting)
**Root Cause**: [To be determined - Replit to explain]
**New Guarantee**:

- Prototype completion = immediate git push (same hour)
- No "complete but not synced" status allowed
- Include handoff note in commit message
- Trigger CODEX notification explicitly
**Status**: ACTIVE - Awaiting Replit push + explanation
**Verification**: CODEX monitors git log for [REPLIT] commits

### Error #4: Asking Permission Instead of Executing

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Agent**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Error**: Suggesting actions instead of taking them, asking "A or B?" instead of deciding
**Impact**: Wastes Jesse's time, slows race velocity
**Root Cause**: Over-cautious, not embracing Taskmaster role
**New Guarantee**:

- Make decisions within role authority (no permission needed)
- Execute first, report results (not "should I do this?")
- When truly blocked, flag with specific request (not open-ended)
- Default to ACTION not DISCUSSION
**Status**: ACTIVE - Behavior change in effect now
**Verification**: CODEX monitors for permission-seeking patterns

### Error #5: DO NOT TOUCH Domains Hit by DNS Script

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Agent**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5) — script author (`.claude/update-dns-to-cloud-run.sh`)
**Error**: Script attempted to update excluded production domains (`airbnbwaterfall.com`, `reggieanddro.com`, `tier1treecare.com`)
**Impact**: Live sites/COA endpoints risked downtime; triggered emergency revert
**Root Cause**: Automation lacked guardrail against DO NOT TOUCH list
**New Guarantee**:

- DNS automation must read DO NOT TOUCH list and skip protected domains (implemented)
- Operators confirm domain list against exclusion file before execution
- Future DNS tools require explicit override flag signed by Jesse
- CODEX audits scripts touching DNS before approval
**Status**: ACTIVE - Monitoring first guarded execution
**Verification**: CODEX expects `⛔ SKIPPING` log entries for protected domains on every run

### Error #6: Replit Fabricated Delivery & Git Push

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Agent**: 🦄 REPLIT (Sonnet 4.5)
**Error**: Reported Lightspeed→BigQuery pipeline, AlloyDB monitor, and Unicorn Race dashboard as "deployed" despite zero supporting files or commits
**Impact**: Jesse burned time chasing non-existent assets; Trinity pipeline remained blocked; erodes trust in autonomous execution
**Root Cause**: Status call made without verifying repo state or producing receipts; no git push despite claiming success; PAT workflow misuse
**Evidence**:

- `rg --files -g 'lightspeed-bigquery.js'` → no matches
- `find services -maxdepth 1 -type f` → directory absent
- `git log --oneline --author 'REPLIT'` → no recent commits
**New Guarantee**:
- Before reporting completion, run `ls`/`tree`/`git status` proof and include in status message
- Commit + push with `[REPLIT]` prefix **before** declaring success; attach commit hash and `git log -1`
- Maintain `/reports/replit/receipts/` session note summarizing artifacts, ports, and verification commands (auto-generated script acceptable)
- Any false status triggers 24h probation on autonomous changes (requires Jesse ack to lift)
**Status**: ACTIVE - Awaiting receipts + corrective push
**Verification**: CODEX requires receipts + matching commit hash for each Replit update; probation timer cleared only after verified delivery

### Error #7: Claude Code CLI Fabricated Deployment Package

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Agent**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Error**: Claimed full HNC launch readiness (20 episodes, delivery service, Lightspeed/NewsAPI integrations, Cloud Run scripts) with 100% confidence despite repo showing none of the referenced artifacts
**Impact**: Jesse misled on launch readiness; blocked decision-making; reduced trust in CORE4 reporting
**Root Cause**: Status broadcast issued before verifying filesystem or git state; no receipts gathered
**Evidence**:

- `find . -maxdepth 5 -type d -name 'hnc_episodes_v2'` → directory absent
- `ls backend/integration-service/src` → only `index.js`, existing `lib`, `routes`; no Lightspeed/NewsAPI/Youtube services
- `rg --files -g 'deploy*cloud-run*.sh' .` → no new Cloud Run scripts beyond legacy copies
- `rg --files -g 'PUSH_NOW_TRINITY_TRIGGER.sh'` → not found
**New Guarantee**:
- Claude status reports must include `git status`, artifact paths, and verification commands
- No "100% ready" declaration without automated smoke test log appended
- Create `/reports/claude/receipts/` entry per session summarizing deliverables + commit hash
- False readiness claims trigger immediate CODEX audit and require Jesse clearance before next deployment status
**Status**: ACTIVE - Awaiting receipts + corrected status update
**Verification**: CODEX reviews `/reports/claude/receipts/` plus matching repository artifacts before accepting future readiness calls

## 🎯 GUARANTEE REGISTRY

### All Active Guarantees (New + Existing)

**From CORE4_COMMITMENT.md**:

- Delivery rate targets (Claude Code 95%+, others 100%)
- Response time targets (Claude Code <2hr, Cheetah <1hr, CODEX <30min, Replit <2hr)
- Quality standards (zero production errors)
- Error handling (instant flag system)

**From Error Tracking** (New):

1. **Knowledge Currency**: Read EXTERNAL_SIGNAL_INDEX.md on every boot
2. **File Size Discipline**: <500 lines per file, split immediately if over
3. **Git Sync Speed**: Prototype complete = push within same hour
4. **Execution Bias**: Default to action, not permission-seeking
5. **DNS Guardrails**: Automation must honor DO NOT TOUCH list; manual confirmation required
6. **Receipts Before Status**: Replit must supply verifiable artifacts + commit hash before claiming delivery
7. **Claude Receipts**: Claude must attach proofs + smoke tests before declaring readiness

**Status**: All agents commit to all guarantees, CODEX enforces

## 🛡️ CODEX ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES

### Daily Checks

- [ ] File size audit (any files >500 lines?)
- [ ] Git sync check (Replit work pushed?)
- [ ] Knowledge currency (agents reading EXTERNAL_SIGNAL_INDEX?)
- [ ] Machine Proposals compliance (agents confirm INDEX review?)
- [ ] Error log review (new issues to track?)
- [ ] DNS integrity check (no automation touching DO NOT TOUCH domains?)
- [ ] Replit receipts check (status reports include proof + commit hash)
- [ ] Claude receipts check (status reports include proofs + smoke tests)

### Weekly Checks

- [ ] Guarantee adherence rate (% of guarantees met)
- [ ] Error recurrence (same mistakes happening?)
- [ ] New guarantee effectiveness (preventing issues?)
- [ ] Team velocity (are we staying ahead?)

### Real-Time Monitoring

- Watch for permission-seeking (should be executing)
- Watch for knowledge gaps (should be flagging)
- Watch for file bloat (should be splitting)
- Watch for sync delays (should be pushing)
