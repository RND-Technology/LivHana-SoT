## ANALYSIS

### What's Happening

1. **<www.reggieanddro.com>:**
   - ‚úÖ CNAME to Lightspeed is correct
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è But Lightspeed is redirecting BACK to root domain
   - This creates a redirect loop potential

2. **reggieanddro.com (root):**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Still pointing to old IPs (3.33.152.147, 15.197.142.173)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Forwarding you added may take 5-15 minutes to propagate
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è OR forwarding needs SSL/HTTPS configuration

3. **SSL Certificate:**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Lightspeed may not have SSL cert for <www.reggieanddro.com>
   - This is why curl shows "unable to get local issuer certificate"
   - Need to configure custom domain in Lightspeed

---

## NEXT STEPS REQUIRED

### 1. Configure Custom Domain in Lightspeed

**You need to tell Lightspeed that reggieanddro.com is YOUR domain:**

1. Login to Lightspeed Retail dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Online Store** (or similar)
3. Find **Custom Domain** settings
4. Add: `reggieanddro.com` and `www.reggieanddro.com`
5. Lightspeed will:
   - Verify DNS is pointing correctly ‚úÖ (it is!)
   - Provision SSL certificate (may take 10-60 minutes)
   - Configure the store to respond on your domain

**Without this step, Lightspeed doesn't know to serve your store on reggieanddro.com**

---

### 2. Wait for DNS Propagation (Forwarding)

**The forwarding you just added may take time:**

- Minimum: 5-15 minutes
- Typical: 30-60 minutes
- Maximum: 2 hours

**Check propagation:**

```bash
# Run this every 5 minutes to check
curl -I http://reggieanddro.com

# When working, you'll see:
# HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# Location: https://www.reggieanddro.com
```

---

### 3. Verify SSL Certificate

**After Lightspeed provisions SSL, test:**

```bash
# Should work without -k flag
curl -I https://www.reggieanddro.com

# Should return:
# HTTP/2 200 OK
# (Lightspeed store content)
```

---

## WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW

### Priority 1: Configure Lightspeed Custom Domain

**This is CRITICAL - Lightspeed needs to know about your domain:**

1. **Login to Lightspeed:**
   - Go to your Lightspeed account
   - Navigate to Settings/Online Store/Domains

2. **Add Custom Domain:**
   - Primary domain: `reggieanddro.com`
   - WWW domain: `www.reggieanddro.com`
   - Lightspeed will verify DNS (should pass ‚úÖ)

3. **Enable SSL:**
   - Lightspeed should auto-provision SSL certificate
   - This may take 10-60 minutes
   - You'll get a notification when ready

**Without this, your DNS is pointing to Lightspeed, but Lightspeed doesn't know to serve YOUR store**

---

### Priority 2: Wait for DNS Propagation

**The forwarding you added needs time:**

- Check again in 15 minutes
- Then every 30 minutes
- Should be fully propagated within 2 hours

---

### Priority 3: Test Everything

**After both steps complete, test:**

```bash
# Test root domain
curl -I http://reggieanddro.com
# Should: 301 redirect to https://www.reggieanddro.com

# Test www domain
curl -I https://www.reggieanddro.com
# Should: 200 OK (Lightspeed store)

# Test in browser
open http://reggieanddro.com
# Should: Redirect to https://www.reggieanddro.com and load store
```

---

## CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

### ‚úÖ DNS Configuration: CORRECT

- Root A records: Set (old IPs, but forwarding added)
- www CNAME: ‚úÖ Correctly points to reggieanddro.company.site
- Forwarding: Added (waiting for propagation)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Lightspeed Configuration: NEEDED

- Custom domain NOT configured in Lightspeed yet
- SSL certificate NOT provisioned yet
- Store doesn't know to serve on reggieanddro.com

### ‚è≥ Propagation: IN PROGRESS

- DNS forwarding: 0-15 minutes elapsed (needs 15-60 more)
- Full effect: May take up to 2 hours

---

## WHAT TO EXPECT

### In 15 minutes

- DNS forwarding should be active
- Root domain should 301 redirect to www
- www will still have SSL errors (until Lightspeed configured)

### In 30-60 minutes (after configuring Lightspeed)

- SSL certificate should be provisioned
- <www.reggieanddro.com> should load store with green padlock
- Root domain should redirect correctly

### Final working state

1. User visits: `http://reggieanddro.com`
2. GoDaddy forwards: ‚Üí `https://www.reggieanddro.com`
3. Lightspeed serves: Store content with SSL ‚úÖ

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### If forwarding still doesn't work after 2 hours

**Check GoDaddy forwarding settings:**

1. Go back to GoDaddy DNS/Forwarding
2. Verify forwarding is active
3. Check it's set to:
   - FROM: `reggieanddro.com` (or `http://reggieanddro.com`)
   - TO: `https://www.reggieanddro.com`
   - Type: `301 Permanent`

### If SSL still errors after configuring Lightspeed

**Wait longer:**

- SSL provisioning can take up to 24 hours
- Let's Encrypt (what Lightspeed uses) needs time to verify

**Or contact Lightspeed support:**

- They can manually trigger SSL certificate generation

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### DO THIS NOW

1. ‚úÖ **Configure custom domain in Lightspeed** (Priority 1)
   - Add reggieanddro.com
   - Add <www.reggieanddro.com>
   - Enable SSL

2. ‚è≥ **Wait 30-60 minutes** for:
   - DNS forwarding to propagate
   - SSL certificate to provision

3. ‚úÖ **Test in browser** after waiting:
   - Visit <http://reggieanddro.com>
   - Should redirect and load store
