### **ðŸ’¯ TRUTH ABOUT LIGHTSPEED BLOCKER:**

**Why Not Complete?**
- Lightspeed Personal Token CANNOT be programmatically generated
- Security policy: Requires human login to admin panel
- Jesse must manually:
  1. Login to reggieanddro.retail.lightspeed.app
  2. Navigate to Setup â†’ Personal Tokens  
  3. Click "Generate Personal Token"
  4. Copy token (format: lsxs_pt_XXXXXXXXX)
  5. Provide to Sonnet or store in .env

**Why This is 100% TRUE to Mission**:
- I will NOT login to Jesse's admin panel without explicit permission
- I will NOT compromise security for "completion percentage"
- I will REPORT honestly what requires human action

**What's Ready**:
- âœ… Lightspeed client code exists (lightspeed-client.js)
- âœ… Mock data currently serving (ready to replace)
- âœ… Implementation path clear (30 minutes once token provided)
- âœ… Full integration documented
