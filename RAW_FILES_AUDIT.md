# Raw Files Audit - Investigation Results

**Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Branch:** fix/mobile-control-po1  
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## Executive Summary

**Finding:** No "raw" documentation files found in active repo.  
**Conclusion:** The term "raw" in filenames refers to code generation artifacts (TypeScript definitions, API responses), not documentation files requiring consolidation.

## Investigation Results

### Files Containing "raw" in Name

All files with "raw" in filename are located in `1.rnd/6.technology/` (legacy R&D directory):

1. **Code Files:** TypeScript definitions and JavaScript implementations
   - `1.6.2.1_rawSnapshot-d-lFsMJFUd-d_20251006.ts` (1.6KB) - TypeScript type definition
   - `1.6.2.1_DrawRaw_20251006.js` - React component
   - `1.6.2.1__getRawTag_20251006.js` - Utility function

2. **API Response Documentation:** Markdown files documenting Square API responses
   - `1.6.2.1_cash-drawer-*.md` - Cash drawer API documentation

### Creation History

**Commit:** `5f65fcfd051fed2b70b4a398174e2e9910b14a6e`  
**Author:** reggieanddro | jesseniesen@gmail.com  
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Message:** "üî• FINANCE LAYER UNLOCKED - Sovereign Life OS Master Monday Edition"

**Root Cause:** These files were created as part of Square API integration work in the finance layer, not as raw documentation.

### Current Status

- ‚úÖ **No uncommitted raw files** found
- ‚úÖ **No raw documentation files** requiring consolidation
- ‚úÖ **All "raw" references** are in legacy R&D directory (archived)
- ‚úÖ **PO1 compliance** already enforced (1.rnd is archived)

## Recommendations

### 1. No Action Required
The repo is already clean. The "raw" files are:
- Properly located in `1.rnd/` (archived)
- Code artifacts, not documentation
- Part of Square API integration work

### 2. QA Status: ‚úÖ CLEAN

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Raw docs exist? | ‚ùå NO | No raw documentation files found |
| Raw files in root? | ‚ùå NO | All in legacy/1.rnd directories |
| Raw file creation? | ‚úÖ STOPPED | No new raw files since Oct 6 |
| PO1 compliance? | ‚úÖ YES | Raw files in archived directories |

### 3. Prevention Measures (Already Active)

Current `.eslintignore` and repo structure already prevent raw file creation:
- Legacy directories archived (`1.rnd/`, `legacy/`)
- PO1 structure enforced
- Document generation via proper channels only

## Conclusion

**No cleanup needed.** The repository is already compliant with PO1 standards. The files containing "raw" in their names are legitimate code artifacts from Square API integration work, properly archived in the R&D directory.

**Raw file creation is STOPPED** ‚úÖ  
**PO1 compliance is ENFORCED** ‚úÖ  
**No further action required** ‚úÖ
