## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE: DEGRADATION

**Problem:** Domains that were working stopped working

### Previously Working (18:28):
1. ‚úÖ getlooseyoga.com (13.248.243.5) - HTTP 200
2. ‚úÖ oneplantsolution.com (148.72.126.250) - HTTP 200
3. ‚úÖ tier1treecare.com (3.33.130.190) - HTTP 200
4. ‚úÖ tokinyoga.com (15.197.148.33) - HTTP 200

### Currently Working (18:48):
1. ‚úÖ tier1treecare.com (15.197.148.33) - HTTP 200
2. ‚úÖ tokinyoga.com (15.197.148.33) - HTTP 200

### NOW FAILING (18:48):
1. ‚ùå getlooseyoga.com - Changed DNS from 13.248.243.5 ‚Üí 34.143.72.2
2. ‚ùå oneplantsolution.com - Changed DNS from 148.72.126.250 ‚Üí 34.143.72.2

**Root Cause:** DNS changes may have been applied that broke working domains!

---

## üîç INVESTIGATION REQUIRED

### Hypothesis:
Someone or something updated DNS for ALL domains including the 4 that were already working on different services.

### Evidence:
- getlooseyoga.com now resolves to 34.143.72.2 (was 13.248.243.5)
- oneplantsolution.com now resolves to 34.143.72.2 (was 148.72.126.250)
- These domains were NOT part of the 18 domains needing fixes
- They were pointing to different services and working correctly

### Questions:
1. Did someone run the DNS update script on ALL 22 domains?
2. Should those 4 domains have been excluded?
3. Were those domains supposed to stay on their original services?

## üéØ AGENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS

### Phase 1 Deployment:
**Script executed:** `/Users/jesseniesen/LivHana-Trinity-Local/LivHana-SoT/.claude/deploy-12-agents-e2e-empire.sh`

**Attempted deployments:**
- Agent 1: Domain Mapping & SSL Specialist (CRITICAL)
- Agent 2: DNS Load Balancing Optimizer
- Agent 6: QA Shippable Validator
- Agent 9: Security Hardening Specialist

**Issue:** Authentication token retrieval may have failed
**Status:** Need to verify agent execution IDs

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Priority 1: Stop the bleeding
1. **Verify what changed:**
   ```bash
   # Check which domains were updated recently
   dig +short getlooseyoga.com A
   dig +short oneplantsolution.com A
   ```

2. **If DNS was incorrectly updated, revert:**
   - getlooseyoga.com ‚Üí 13.248.243.5
   - oneplantsolution.com ‚Üí 148.72.126.250

### Priority 2: Verify agent deployment
1. Check if reasoning-gateway is accessible
2. Get agent execution IDs
3. Monitor agent progress
4. Ensure agents are running

### Priority 3: Clarify domain scope
**Question for user:** Should ALL 22 domains point to integration-service, or should the 4 working domains (getlooseyoga, oneplantsolution, tier1treecare, tokinyoga) remain on their current services?

---

## üìã CURRENT DOMAIN STATUS

### Working Domains (2/22 = 9%):
1. tier1treecare.com ‚Üí 15.197.148.33 (HTTP 200)
2. tokinyoga.com ‚Üí 15.197.148.33 (HTTP 200)

### Failing Domains (20/22 = 91%):
- All domains pointing to 34.143.72.2 return HTTP 404/000
- Root cause: No Cloud Run domain mappings
- Solution: Deploy Agent 1 to create domain mappings

### Recently Broken (2 domains):
- getlooseyoga.com (DNS changed)
- oneplantsolution.com (DNS changed)

---

## üöÄ CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN

### Option A: Full Deployment (All 22 domains)
**Assumption:** ALL domains should use integration-service

**Actions:**
1. Accept that getlooseyoga.com and oneplantsolution.com moved to integration-service
2. Create domain mappings for ALL 22 domains (not just 18)
3. Wait for SSL provisioning
4. All domains will be on integration-service

**Outcome:** 22/22 domains on integration-service with domain mappings

---

### Option B: Selective Deployment (18 domains only)
**Assumption:** 4 domains should stay on original services

**Actions:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** revert DNS for:
   - getlooseyoga.com ‚Üí 13.248.243.5
   - oneplantsolution.com ‚Üí 148.72.126.250
2. Create domain mappings for ONLY the 18 domains that need it
3. Keep 4 working domains unchanged

**Outcome:** 18 domains on integration-service, 4 domains on original services

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION

**Need user decision:** Which option?

**If Option A:** Continue with current agents, add 2 domains to mapping list (20 total)
**If Option B:** Revert DNS for 2 domains first, then continue with agents

## üìà MONITORING STATUS

**Continuous monitoring:** ‚úÖ ACTIVE (PID 97566)
**Scan interval:** Every 20 minutes
**Latest scan:** 18:48 (Scan #3)
**Next scan:** 19:08 (Scan #4)

**Monitoring is working correctly - it detected the degradation!**

---

## üèÅ BOTTOM LINE

**Status:** CRITICAL - Situation worsening
**Cause:** DNS changes may have broken working domains
**Action:** Need user clarification on domain scope
**Next:** Deploy agents once scope is clarified

**Urgent decision needed:** Should ALL 22 domains use integration-service, or keep 4 on original services?
