### 2. Cloud Run Domain Mapping: NOT CREATED ❌

**Status:** 0/18 domains mapped (0%)

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ curl -k -I https://aaacbdhempflower.com
HTTP/2 404
# Returns 404, not SSL error - this means:
# ✅ DNS works (resolves to Cloud Run)
# ✅ HTTPS/SSL works (no certificate error)
# ❌ Domain mapping doesn't exist (404 - not found)
```

**THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS:**
- Previous scan showed SSL errors
- Now showing 404 errors
- This means Cloud Run is receiving requests
- Just needs domain mappings created

**What's needed:**
```bash
# For each of 18 domains:
gcloud run domain-mappings create \
    --service integration-service \
    --domain aaacbdhempflower.com \
    --region us-central1 \
    --project livhana-439623
```

**Grade:** F (Critical blocker)
