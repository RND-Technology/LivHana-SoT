### Phase 3: API Testing (AFTER Phase 1 - 20 min)

**Status:** Blocked by domain mapping
**Wait for:** SSL certificates ready

**Actions:**
```bash
# Test each domain once HTTPS works
for domain in [18 domains]; do
    curl -s "https://$domain/api/age-verification/status" | jq .
    curl -s "https://$domain/health" | jq .
done
```

**Expected outcome:**
- 16/18+ APIs functional (90%+) ✅
- Health checks passing ✅
- Database connectivity verified ✅
