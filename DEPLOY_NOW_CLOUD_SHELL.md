# üöÄ DEPLOY NOW IN CLOUD SHELL

**Status:** READY TO DEPLOY WITHOUT API KEYS
**Strategy:** Mock data mode enabled - services won't crash

---

## STEP 1: FIX GCP COMMAND (Copy-Paste This)

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding reggieanddrodispensary --member="user:jesseniesen@gmail.com" --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
```

**Why:** Single line, no line breaks. Your original had formatting issues.

---

## STEP 2: DEPLOY EVERYTHING (Emergency Mode)

```bash
# Clone repo to Cloud Shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/RND-Technology/LivHana-SoT.git
cd LivHana-SoT

# Run emergency deployment
chmod +x scripts/deploy-without-keys.sh
./scripts/deploy-without-keys.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Deploys Webhook Listener (no APIs needed)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Deploys YouTube Analyzer (MOCK MODE)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Deploys NewsAPI Pipeline (MOCK MODE)
4. ‚úÖ Deploys Content Engine (works with mock data)

**Timeline:** 15 minutes to all services running

---

## MOCK MODE BEHAVIOR

### YouTube Analyzer (MOCK MODE):
- Returns 10 sample viral videos
- Random engagement metrics
- Works for testing/development
- **Upgrade:** Add real API key later

### NewsAPI Pipeline (MOCK MODE):
- Returns 20 sample cannabis news articles
- Realistic topics (legalization, CBD, etc.)
- Works for content generation
- **Upgrade:** Add real API key later

### Content Engine:
- Can generate episodes with mock data
- 8-character cast ready
- TPOPS optimization active
- **Functional immediately**

### Webhook Listener:
- 100% functional (no external APIs)
- HMAC validation working
- Ready for Lightspeed orders
- **Production ready NOW**

---

## UPGRADE PATH (Later)

When you get API keys, just update environment variables:

```bash
# YouTube Analyzer
gcloud run services update youtube-analyzer \
  --update-env-vars YOUTUBE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY \
  --region us-central1

# NewsAPI Pipeline
gcloud run services update newsapi-pipeline \
  --update-env-vars NEWSAPI_KEY=YOUR_KEY \
  --region us-central1
```

Services will automatically switch from mock to real data.

---

## VERIFICATION

After deployment completes:

```bash
# Check all services deployed
gcloud run services list --region=us-central1

# Test webhook listener
curl https://lightspeed-webhook-XXXXX-uc.a.run.app/health

# Test YouTube analyzer
curl https://youtube-analyzer-XXXXX-uc.a.run.app/api/patterns/latest

# Test NewsAPI pipeline
curl https://newsapi-pipeline-XXXXX-uc.a.run.app/api/news/latest

# Test content engine
curl https://hnc-content-engine-XXXXX-uc.a.run.app/health
```

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Immediate (15 minutes):
- ‚úÖ 4 services deployed to Cloud Run
- ‚úÖ All health checks passing
- ‚úÖ Webhook listener accepting requests
- ‚úÖ Content engine generating episodes

### Short-term (1 hour):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Mock data being used for development
- ‚úÖ System operational and testable
- ‚úÖ Ready for Lightspeed integration

### Long-term (when keys added):
- ‚úÖ Real viral pattern analysis
- ‚úÖ Real-time cannabis news
- ‚úÖ Optimized content generation
- ‚úÖ Full production mode

## UNBLOCKING REPLIT

Once Cloud Run services are deployed:

1. Get service URLs from Cloud Run
2. Update Replit environment variables
3. Replit can call Cloud Run APIs
4. Full Trinity coordination active

**Replit is NO LONGER BLOCKED**

---

**EXECUTE NOW IN CLOUD SHELL:**

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding reggieanddrodispensary --member="user:jesseniesen@gmail.com" --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"

./scripts/deploy-without-keys.sh
```

**15 minutes to operational!** üöÄ
