# Find complaints about: slow delivery, high prices, poor selection
hot_leads = filter_reviews(scraped_reviews, pain_points=["slow", "expensive", "limited"])

# Auto-generate personalized outreach
for lead in hot_leads:
    message = f"Hi {lead.name}, saw your review about {lead.complaint}.
    At Liv Hana, we offer {our_solution}. First order 20% off."

    send_to_slack_for_approval(message)
    if approved:
        send_outreach(lead, message)
        log_revenue_opportunity(estimated_value=120)

### Skill: Price Intelligence Scraper

**Revenue Impact**: $300-800/day (competitive pricing advantage)
**Time to Deploy**: 1-2 hours
**Purpose**: Auto-scrape competitor prices, optimize yours for maximum margin

2. Identifies price gaps (products you can price higher)
3. Identifies opportunities (products you should stock)
4. Auto-adjusts your pricing in LightSpeed
5. Alerts team to arbitrage opportunities

**Example**:

```python
# Scrape 5 competitors every morning
competitor_prices = {
    "CompetitorA": scrape_weedmaps("competitor-a"),
    "CompetitorB": scrape_leafly("competitor-b"),
    "CompetitorC": scrape_website("competitor-c.com")
}

# Find arbitrage opportunities
for product in your_inventory:
    avg_competitor_price = calculate_average(competitor_prices, product.name)

    if avg_competitor_price > product.price * 1.15:
        # You can raise price by 10% and still be competitive
        new_price = product.price * 1.10
        update_lightspeed_price(product, new_price)

        margin_increase = (new_price - product.cost) - (product.price - product.cost)
        log_revenue_opportunity(margin_increase * product.monthly_volume)
```

**Revenue Model**:

- 20 products with 10% price increase
- Average $50 price → $55 price = $5 more margin
- 10 units/month per product × 20 products × $5 = $1,000/month = $33/day
