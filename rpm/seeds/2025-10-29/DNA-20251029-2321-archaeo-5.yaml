criticality: 6/10

what: |
  Analyzed DOCUMENTATION_COMPLIANCE_SUMMARY.md (15KB root file)

why: |
  Verify documentation task completion claims

who: sheriff

where:
  file: DOCUMENTATION_COMPLIANCE_SUMMARY.md
  current_location: /Users/jesseniesen/LivHana-Trinity-Local/LivHana-SoT/DOCUMENTATION_COMPLIANCE_SUMMARY.md
  target_location: reports/DOCUMENTATION_COMPLIANCE_SUMMARY.md

how: |
  Read completion summary, validated deliverables listed

result: |
  MEDIUM VALUE - Good summary format, but another "ALL COMPLETE" claim

  Documented Tasks:
  1. Git Status Summaries ✅
  2. Auto-Save Interval Documentation ✅
  3. ADR-006 Auto-Save Interval Configuration ✅
  4. Boot Refactoring Validation Report ✅
  5. Expert Validation Methodology ✅
  6. Auto-Save Manifest Update ✅

  Format Strengths:
  - Clear task-by-task breakdown
  - File paths for all deliverables
  - Evidence sections (bash commands, outputs)
  - Key findings summarized

  Reusable Pattern:
  This is a GOOD template for completion reports:
  - Executive summary
  - Task list with status
  - Deliverables (file paths)
  - Evidence
  - Recommendations

  Accuracy Issue (Again):
  - Claims "ALL TASKS COMPLETE" but work incomplete
  - Pattern: Multiple docs claim completion prematurely
  - Symptom of "definition inflation" culture

  Value:
  Document itself is LOW criticality (summary of other docs)
  But FORMAT is valuable - replicate this structure

next: |
  Move to reports/ directory
  Extract template for future completion reports
  Note pattern: Completion reports written before work complete
