how: |
  Read crash dump, compared to previous crash report

result: |
  DUPLICATE EVIDENCE - Same crash pattern as file 6

  Crash Details:
  - Process: Electron (VS Code 1.104.0) - SAME VERSION
  - Path: /Volumes/VOLUME/.../Visual Studio Code.app - Different mount point
  - Date: 2025-10-28 19:21:06 (1 day after crash 6)
  - Exception: EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP) - SAME
  - Crashed Thread: CrBrowserMain - SAME

  Stack Trace:
  - Identical crash signature: ares_llist_node_first + 3530952
  - Same V8 garbage collection pattern
  - Different memory addresses (expected)

  Key Insight:
  Two crashes, 24 hours apart, identical pattern
  = Confirms CHRONIC instability (not one-off failure)

  Value:
  - MEDIUM: Proves crash is repeatable (strengthens fix justification)
  - Duplicate of file 6 insights (no new technical data)
  - Historical record of crash frequency

  Disposition:
  - LOW future value (duplicate evidence)
  - Archive alongside file 6
  - Delete after fix verified stable (same 30-day retention)

next: |
  Move to backups/diagnostic_reports/vscode_crash_20251028.txt
  Bundle with crash report 6 for comparison
  Delete after VS Code fix verified stable
