how: |
  Read file, compared planned phases vs actual completion

result: |
  ASPIRATIONAL DOCUMENT - Describes intended work, not completed work

  Planned Phases (5 total):
  - Phase 0: Local Backup ‚úÖ COMPLETE (backups/local_20251029_215149/)
  - Phase 1: Auto-Save ‚úÖ COMPLETE (auto_save_local.sh running)
  - Phase 2: Boot Refactoring ‚úÖ COMPLETE (START.sh 784‚Üí28 lines)
  - Phase 3: Validation üü° PARTIAL (structural validation only, no live boot test)
  - Phase 4: Production Components ‚ùå INCOMPLETE (STOP.sh, TEST.sh, validate.sh missing)

  Key Insight: Document Claims vs Reality
  - Title says "FINAL" but work is INCOMPLETE
  - This is a PLAN not a VALIDATION REPORT
  - Classic "definition inflation" anti-pattern

  What Worked:
  - Excellent step-by-step execution instructions
  - Clear bash commands that could be copy-pasted
  - Verification steps after each phase

  What Failed:
  - Only ~60% of plan actually executed
  - No update to document after partial completion
  - Creates false confidence ("FINAL" in title)

  Jesse's Standards Violated:
  - "Complete" doesn't mean complete
  - Document accuracy critical for trust
  - Should be labeled "INCOMPLETE" or "IN PROGRESS"

next: |
  Rename to EXECUTION_ARTIFACT_INCOMPLETE.md
  Move to docs/planning/ directory
  Add header: "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Only Phases 0-2 completed. Phases 3-4 pending."
