how: |
  Read validation methodology, cross-checked claims vs QA findings

result: |
  HIGH VALUE - Excellent methodology documentation, but overstated conclusions

  Validation Methodology (PRESERVE):
  - Multi-phase approach: Discovery → Design → Implementation → Operational
  - Static code analysis (ShellCheck)
  - Dependency mapping
  - Architecture documentation
  - ADR-based design validation

  Key Strengths:
  - Structured validation process (industry best practice)
  - Evidence-based approach (git commits, file counts, line numbers)
  - Comprehensive documentation (1,196 lines boot analysis)
  - ShellCheck integration (6,775 files validated)

  Accuracy Issue:
  - Claims: "PRODUCTION READY"
  - Reality: QA score 72/100, 20% production criteria met
  - Overstated conclusion (methodology sound, conclusion premature)

  Insights Extracted:
  - Validation process itself is excellent (replicate for future work)
  - Evidence collection thorough
  - Gap: Validation methodology vs production readiness criteria mismatch

  Jesse's Principles Demonstrated:
  - Evidence-based decisions (citations, git commits)
  - Expert validation before execution
  - Documentation thoroughness

next: |
  Move to docs/validation/ directory
  Note: Methodology excellent, conclusion needs revision
  Use this framework for future validation work
