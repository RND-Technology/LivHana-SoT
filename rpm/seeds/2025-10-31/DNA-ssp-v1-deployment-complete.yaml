```

## Verification Commands Run
```bash
# Service status
lsof -i :8080
# Result: PID 46263 listening on port 8080

# Test endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/reasoning/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Quick test"}'
# Result: 3.7s response with GPT-5

# Verify feedback logs
ls -la backend/voice-service/tmp/agent_status/feedback/
# Result: 3 feedback log files confirmed

# Verify memory sync
cat backend/voice-service/tmp/agent_status/memory_loop.json
# Result: Valid JSON with agent context
