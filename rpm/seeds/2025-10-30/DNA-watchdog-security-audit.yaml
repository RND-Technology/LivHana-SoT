# ============================================================================
# LESSONS LEARNED & BEST PRACTICES
# ============================================================================

lessons_learned:
  - principle: "Verify → Measure → Then Claim"
    application: "Every fix was verified with direct evidence before claiming success"
    example: "Used Read tool to inspect all watchdogs before claiming 'most already fixed'"

  - principle: "Atomic operations prevent corruption"
    application: "All file writes now use temp file + mv pattern"
    impact: "Eliminates race conditions and partial write corruption"

  - principle: "Stale lock detection is critical"
    application: "Check PID validity, process existence, and file age"
    impact: "Prevents manual intervention after SIGKILL"

  - principle: "Defense in depth for credentials"
    application: "Multiple layers of exclusion patterns (wildcard + explicit)"
    impact: "Even if one pattern fails, others catch leakage"

  - principle: "Marine Corps Precision requires evidence"
    application: "Every truth claim backed by file:line references"
    impact: "100% confidence in audit accuracy"
