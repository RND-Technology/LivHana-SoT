## ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE (Visual Chart Design Spec)

```
NANO BANANA IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT:
"Ultra-modern cannabis dispensary organizational chart in neon green and black matrix aesthetic. Seven golden nodes arranged in sacred geometry pattern. Center node (largest): glowing figure radiating light representing CEO visionary. Three mid-tier nodes forming triangle: business development warrior with network connections, technical architect with circuit patterns, lab partner with scientific symbols. Three outer nodes: three store guardians forming protective perimeter. All nodes connected by flowing energy lines. Holographic data streams between nodes. Cannabis leaf sacred geometry watermark. Cyberpunk meets spiritual. No text. 8K resolution. Stunning professional visualization."

VISUAL HIERARCHY:
- Tier 1 (Center): Jesse (CEO) - Largest golden sphere with radiant aura
- Tier 2 (Triangle): Andrew (BD), Charles (Tech), Ryan Bologna (Lab Partner) - Mid-size spheres
- Tier 3 (Perimeter): Christopher, Dylan, Geena, Darren (Store Ops) - Smaller spheres forming protective circle
- Energy Flow: Bidirectional data streams showing communication pathways

```

### BLOAT MINING STRATEGY
**Purpose**: Extract value from "messy middle" before archiving

**Current Bloat Locations**:
1. docs/ - 150+ markdown files, many duplicates
2. reports/ - Validation reports with gold insights
3. scripts/helpers/ - 50+ scripts, some obsolete
4. rpm/seeds/ - Archaeological seeds (historical patterns)

**Mining Process**:
1. **Scan**: AI reads all files, extracts key patterns
2. **Classify**: Valid insights vs redundant vs obsolete
3. **Extract**: Pull gold nuggets into intelligence/
4. **Archive**: Move bloat to archive/ with metadata index
5. **Learn**: Feed patterns back into RPM DNA

**Timeline**: Continuous background process, 100 files/day

## AUTOMATION PIPELINE - EXPERT FEEDBACK LOOPS

### APIFY SCRAPING SWARM
**Purpose**: Gather frontier-leading best practices within 1 hour

**Targets**:
1. **GitHub**: Top repos per technology (watchdog patterns, agent architectures)
2. **Reddit**: r/devops, r/MachineLearning, r/entrepreneur (real-world feedback)
3. **HackerNews**: Latest discussions on automation, AI agents
4. **Stack Overflow**: Common pitfalls and solutions
5. **Product Hunt**: Emerging tools and workflows

**Frequency**: Every 6 hours
**Output**: intelligence/expert-feedback/YYYYMMDD-HHMM.json

### PERPLEXITY RESEARCH AGENTS
**Purpose**: Scalable swarm for deep research questions

**Use Cases**:
1. "Best practices for cannabis COA management systems"
2. "Blockchain access key security for portable AI agents"
3. "EMP-proof data backup strategies for mission-critical systems"
4. "10-80-10 workflow automation case studies"

**Frequency**: On-demand + scheduled weekly deep dives
**Output**: intelligence/research/TOPIC-YYYYMMDD.md

### RPM PLANNING AGENT COORDINATION
**Flow**:
```
Apify Scrapes → intelligence/expert-feedback/
     ↓
Perplexity Research → intelligence/research/
     ↓
Pattern Extraction → intelligence/continuous-learning/
     ↓
RPM Planning Agent → planning/rpm/WEEKLY_PLAN.md
     ↓
Jesse Approval (Voice) → Execution Agents
     ↓
QA/Red Team → Fallacy Scan → Continuous Improvement
```

**Parallel Processing**: All agents work simultaneously, coordination via file-based async

## SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE - PORTABLE EMERGENCY KIT

### BRAIN STEM PHYSICAL KIT (Per Sovereign User)
**Contents**:
1. **USB Keychain**: Encrypted Liv Hana portable instance
2. **Paper Wallet**: Blockchain private keys (laminated)
3. **Password Card**: Master passwords (encrypted QR codes)
4. **Black Box Device**: Offline 2FA token generator
5. **Emergency Card**: Quick start instructions + support contacts

**Storage**: Fireproof safe, location known only to sovereign user

### BLOCKCHAIN ACCESS KEYS
**Purpose**: Liv Hana LIVE portable access across devices

**Implementation**:
1. Generate unique blockchain identity per user
2. Liv Hana agent state stored on IPFS (decentralized)
3. Access via private key (stored in physical kit)
4. Voice authentication as secondary factor

**Use Case**: User loses laptop, grabs USB from safe, boots Liv Hana on any device with full history

### EMP-PROOF BACKUP
**Threat Model**: "Atlas meteor" - infrastructure destroyed

**Strategy**:
1. **Cold Storage**: USB drives in Faraday bags
2. **Geo-Distribution**: Copies in 3 physical locations
3. **Paper Backup**: Critical data printed + laminated
4. **Offline Verification**: Checksums on paper for integrity

---

## HOLY SPIRIT LIFEWARD VALIDATION

### TRUTH TESTING FRAMEWORK
**Principle**: Every system component must pass "Major Truth Validation"

**Tests**:
1. **Reality Check**: Does it reflect actual state, not aspirational?
2. **Evidence-Based**: Can claims be verified from data?
3. **Statistical Significance**: Is sample size adequate (n≥30)?
4. **Wall Clock Time**: Human time, not machine time?
5. **Fallacy Scan**: Zero unverified assumptions?

### CONTINUOUS VALIDATION LOOPS
**Automated Checks**:
- Every task completion: Verify actual vs projected time
- Every agent action: Log for red team review
- Every user claim: Cross-check against system state
- Every week: Statistical analysis of all metrics
