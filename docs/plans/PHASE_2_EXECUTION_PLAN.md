# Project LivHana: Phase 2 Execution Plan

**Document ID**: PLAN-PHASE2-20251030
**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Proposed

---

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the strategy, plan, and design for Phase 2 of Project LivHana. It incorporates the latest directives to integrate visualization layers, real-time cognitive orchestration, and context engineering for all AI agents, enabling the entire system to operate at the next level.

This plan builds upon the successful completion of Phase 1 and the ongoing work to resolve the P0 voice latency blocker.

## 2. Core Objectives for Phase 2

1.  **Achieve Real-Time Cognitive Orchestration**: Move from a reactive to a proactive, self-improving system that can anticipate needs and orchestrate agents in unison.
2.  **Implement "Ferrari Cockpit" Visualization Layers**: Deliver the custom VIP dashboards to provide real-time, role-specific intelligence to all 7 Golden VIPs.
3.  **Harden All System Artifacts**: Apply a rigorous "Red Team" QA process to all code, plans, and designs before execution.
4.  **Context Engineer All Agents**: Relaunch "Comet" and "Fake Live Hana" with a deep, shared understanding of the project's goals, best practices, and technical architecture.
5.  **Execute the "80% Automation" Mandate**: Begin the full-scale deployment of the agent swarm, repository restructuring, and continuous "bloat mining."

## 3. Detailed Execution Plan

This plan will be executed in parallel tracks where possible.

### Track 1: Foundational Infrastructure & Orchestration (P0)

*   **Task 1.1: Complete Voice Latency Fix (IN-PROGRESS)**
    *   **Description**: Finalize the transition to direct HTTP calls, switch to GPT-4o-mini, and fully eliminate the BullMQ polling bottleneck.
    *   **Owner**: Real Live Hana
    *   **ETA**: Complete

*   **Task 1.2: Implement Real-Time Cognitive Orchestration Engine**
    *   **Description**: Design and build the core engine that manages the "triple Lindy, round robin" multi-model QA process. This engine will be responsible for orchestrating `planning`, `research`, `qa`, `execmon`, and `artifact` agents.
    *   **Owner**: Planning Agent
    *   **ETA**: 3 days

*   **Task 1.3: Context Engineering & Agent Relaunch**
    *   **Description**: Create a "Context Alignment" document. Use this document to relaunch and context-engineer "Comet" and "Fake Live Hana" so they operate with a unified understanding of the project.
    *   **Owner**: Artifact Agent
    *   **ETA**: 1 day

### Track 2: VIP Cockpits & Visualization Layer

*   **Task 2.1: Finalize and Deploy VIP Cockpits**
    *   **Description**: Complete the development and deployment of the custom dashboards for all 7 Golden VIPs, starting with Charles and the Store Ops team.
    *   **Owner**: Execmon Agent
    *   **ETA**: 5 days

*   **Task 2.2: Integrate AlloyDB for Real-Time Analytics**
    *   **Description**: Migrate the data backend for the VIP cockpits to AlloyDB to leverage its speed for real-time analytical queries and transactional workloads.
    *   **Owner**: Execmon Agent
    *   **ETA**: 4 days

### Track 3: Automation & Intelligence Pipeline

*   **Task 3.1: Deploy Pifi/Proplexity Scraper Swarm**
    *   **Description**: Launch the automated scraper swarm to continuously gather intelligence from the specified online platforms.
    *   **Owner**: Research Agent
    *   **ETA**: 2 days

*   **Task 3.2: Implement "Bloat Mining" Protocol**
    *   **Description**: Begin the systematic analysis of the repository's legacy code against the "perfect 10" vision, creating actionable refactoring tasks.
    *   **Owner**: QA Agent
    - **ETA**: Ongoing

### Track 4: Repository & Physical Artifacts

*   **Task 4.1: Restructure Repository**
    *   **Description**: Execute the planned repository restructuring, creating the `core_brain_stem`, `intelligence`, and `cockpit` directories.
    - **Owner**: Execmon Agent
    - **ETA**: 1 day

*   **Task 4.2: Harden Emergency Kit Protocol**
    *   **Description**: Finalize the design and specifications for the physical "brain stem" emergency kit, including hardware specs and blockchain key management procedures.
    - **Owner**: Artifact Agent
    - **ETA**: 2 days

## 4. Next Steps

I will now update the main to-do list to reflect this detailed Phase 2 plan. I will then proceed with the highest priority task that is not blocked.
