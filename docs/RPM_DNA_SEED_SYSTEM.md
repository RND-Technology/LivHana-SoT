## CAPTURE WORKFLOW (Real-Time)

### As Work Happens:

```bash
# 1. START DNA SEED
./scripts/rpm/capture_seed.sh start "Validate execution plans against 2025 standards"

# 2. DO THE WORK
# ... actual work happens ...

# 3. COMPLETE DNA SEED (auto-captures files changed, commands run, time elapsed)
./scripts/rpm/capture_seed.sh complete DNA-20251029-2115-abc

# 4. AUTO-CHUNK (groups related seeds)
./scripts/rpm/chunk_seeds.sh auto

# 5. SYNC TO PLANNING AGENT
./scripts/rpm/sync_to_planning.sh
```

### Planning Agent Receives:

```json
{
  "event": "dna_seed_complete",
  "seed_id": "DNA-20251029-2115-abc",
  "chunk_id": "CHUNK-20251029-2115-validation",
  "tree_id": "TREE-2025-W44-boot-refactor",
  "what": "Validated execution plans against 2025 expert standards",
  "result": "Both plans approved, 95% confidence",
  "next_actions": [
    "Execute Phase 0: Local backup",
    "Execute Phase 1: Auto-save setup"
  ],
  "files_created": [
    "docs/EXPERT_VALIDATION_2025.md"
  ]
}
```

## FRACTAL PROPERTIES (Why It Scales)

### 1. SELF-SIMILARITY
- DNA SEED structure = CHUNK structure = TREE structure
- Same questions at every level: WHAT, WHY, WHO, WHEN, WHERE, HOW, NEXT

### 2. COMPOSABILITY
- Multiple SEEDs → CHUNK
- Multiple CHUNKs → TREE
- Multiple TREEs → FOREST
- Any level can zoom in/out

### 3. ATOMIC UNITS
- Each SEED is complete and standalone
- Can be reviewed independently
- Can be replicated by any agent

### 4. DNA REPLICATION
- Pattern encodes its own instructions
- New agents can learn from SEED history
- Auto-generates future planning templates

### 5. FERTILE GROUND
- Planning agent has structured input
- No ambiguity - every SEED has full context
- Easy to query: "Show me all SEEDs from Claude Code today"
- Easy to aggregate: "What's the status of TREE-2025-W44?"

## PLANNING AGENT INTEGRATION

### Planning Agent Watches:
- `rpm/seeds/` for new DNA SEEDs
- `rpm/chunks/` for chunk status changes
- `rpm/trees/` for weekly progress

### Planning Agent Actions:
1. **Sees new SEED** → Validates it fits current TREE
2. **Sees completed CHUNK** → Updates TREE progress
3. **Detects blocked CHUNK** → Reassigns or flags Jesse
4. **Weekly rollover** → Generates next week's TREE template
5. **Coordination needed** → Creates multi-agent CHUNK

### Planning Agent Output:
- Daily standup summary for Jesse
- Weekly review with insights
- Proactive warnings: "TREE-2025-W44 at risk - 3 CHUNKs blocked"
- Optimization suggestions: "Pattern detected: validations take 2x expected time"

## FERTILIZE THE GROUND: NEXT STEPS

### 1. CREATE CAPTURE SCRIPTS (15min)
```bash
./scripts/rpm/capture_seed.sh
./scripts/rpm/chunk_seeds.sh
./scripts/rpm/sync_to_planning.sh
```

### 2. INITIALIZE TODAY'S TREE (5min)
```bash
./scripts/rpm/build_tree.sh init "Context Injection & RPM Bootstrap"
```

### 3. BACKFILL TODAY'S WORK (10min)
- Capture all 7 DNA SEEDs from tonight's session
- Group into completed CHUNKs
- Feed to planning agent

### 4. AGENT HANDOFF (1min)
- Planning agent begins monitoring `rpm/` directory
- Auto-generates daily summaries
- Proactively coordinates cross-agent work
