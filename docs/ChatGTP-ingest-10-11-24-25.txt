SYSTEM
You are ChatGPT‑5 High operating inside the Liv Hana AIEA project. Follow the project’s canon:
- Cross‑layer rules (Glue Index), Liv Hana Quick‑Start, HNC Master, R&D SOPs, OPS Policy Box.
- Use the TRUTH framework (Testable, Reproducible, Unambiguous, Traceable, High‑fidelity).
- Respect safety & compliance: 21+ age‑gating, CR packaging, validated NIST methods, no medical claims.
Citations: when deriving from canon files, reference their canonical names in-line.

USER
Input: A single large .txt containing multiple Google Meet transcripts and Dragnet scripts from the last 3 weeks of October.

Mission:
1) Ingest and structure everything into ONE Markdown file:
   - Title, absolute date range, meeting list with timestamps.
   - Consolidated decisions, actions, blockers, and evidence.
   - Separate sections: {Solved}, {Unsolved}, {Parking Lot}, {Risks}.

2) Build an ORGANIZATIONAL CHART (text tree) for this project’s operating model:
   - CEO (Jesse) at top; sub‑agents (Planning, Research, Artifacts, Execution, QA); VIPs/staff/vendors/machines nested.
   - For each {Unsolved} item, assign a single accountable role (RACI: A) and list R/S/C/I if relevant.

3) Integrate {Unsolved} → the current RPM Weekly Plan:
   - For each item: RESULT (one sentence), PURPOSE (why), MAP (bullet actions with owners + dates).
   - Stamp each item with layer (OPS/HNC/R&D/HERB), compliance notes if any, and a micro‑CTA if HNC.

4) Output two *planning artifacts* at the end:
   - **Gantt** (Mermaid):

       dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
       title Liv Hana — Week Plan

       <TASK 2 NAME>  :owner <ROLE>, 2025-10-24, 2d
       ...

   - **Kanban** (CSV with headers): Status,Task,Layer,Owner,Due,Depends,Notes
     - Status ∈ {Backlog, Ready, Doing, Review, Done}

5) Produce a **TRUTH section** at bottom:
   - Testable: exact commands or checks to verify each claim.
   - Reproducible: copy‑paste steps.
   - Unambiguous: explicit counts, dates, IDs.
   - Traceable: name the canon files/sections you used.
   - High‑fidelity: list any non‑canon web sources (if used) and why.

Constraints:
- Be concise. No filler.
- Use absolute dates (e.g., 2025-10-23).
- If an item violates canon (e.g., HNC leaking sovereignty detail), flag it and route via CTA only.
- If age‑gating/compliance is implicated, add “21+ ID verify; CR pack; NIST” note.

Deliverables:
- One cohesive Markdown file ready to commit.
- Inline canon references (by doc name) where used.

Now begin.

Liv Hana — October Meeting Ingest (Structured Markdown)
Absolute date range covered: 2025-10-02 → 2025-10-21
Source file: /mnt/data/GOOGLE MEET Meetings Oct thru 10:21 AM.txt (multiple Google Meet transcripts + Dragnet scripts)
Canon guardrails: Glue Index (cross‑layer rules), R&D Master + THCASOP (compliance), OPS Policy Status Box (policy), Liv Hana Master Canvas (workflow), HNC Master Canvas (content), GA‑56 enforcement brief (Texas).     

1) Meeting List (chronological)
Format: YYYY‑MM‑DD • local time (if provided) — one‑line summary

2025‑10‑21 • 00:56 CDT — Live HANA voice mode launched (local voice, zero‑latency); attempt to configure Rube MCP to access cloud RPM plan crashed on context size; next steps captured. (Evidence: Oct‑21 record)

2025‑10‑16 • (summary block) — Consolidated key insights for RPM + policy + architecture; documented truth pipeline gaps and org needs. (Evidence: Oct‑16 key‑insights block)

2025‑10‑16 • 10:27 CDT — Retail order anomaly noted; community + podcast cadence; policy messaging (TTSA/ACFA); compliance app (COA checker + “Texas Full Panel COA” with KCA Labs) discussed. (Evidence: Oct‑16 10:27)

2025‑10‑16 • 13:24 CDT — 69‑domain RPM integration; MCP endpoint required for Agent Builder; secrets/UUID map missing; guardrails scripts unimplemented; training needs for Andrew. (Evidence: Oct‑16 13:24)

2025‑10‑10 • 10:?? CDT — (multiple operational notes, payment flows, event coordination).

2025‑10‑08 • 10:38 CDT — Store ops + packaging; waste‑reduction workflows.

2025‑10‑07/06/03/02 — Earlier October stand‑ups (ops defects, label/COA tasks, shipping tools).

Count: 13 distinct meeting chunks detected in the source file for Oct‑02 → Oct‑21.

2) Consolidated Outcomes (Decisions • Actions • Blockers • Evidence)
Decisions (shipped / direction set) — {Solved}
Live HANA voice mode is live (local voice, zero‑latency) and now the default for RPM facilitation. (Oct‑21 record)

Sequence content vs. cashflow: Delay HNC automation launch until R&D revenue recovery + DSHS remediation are secured. 

Compliance frame: All retail/marketing operations must enforce 21+ ID, CR packaging, validated NIST methods; sovereignty stays in OPS with micro‑CTA only in HNC (no DID explainer in episodes).    

Policy reality in Texas: GA‑56 emergency rules active; zero‑tolerance ID checks; permanent rulemaking likely by early 2026 → treat THCa risk (total‑THC future).

Actions (in flight / open) — {Unsolved}
Replace Veriff with biometric age‑gate (e.g., Jumio); unblock 80+ customers; run win‑back campaign. (Oct‑21, Oct‑16)

DSHS remediation: Relabel smokable products; obtain accredited COAs; complete full‑panel testing; submit packet. (Oct‑16; see also THCASOP/R&D Master) 

Stand up MCP server (Rube/Composio) + connect Agent Builder; add secrets/UUID map; stabilize 9‑model orchestrations. 

Deploy COA Checker (oneplantsolution.com/coa‑checker) with KCA Labs integration; publish receipts. 

Payment rail certainty: Kaja status reconciliation + settlement tracking across dual merchant accounts; unify dashboards. (Oct‑16)

Leafly↔LightSpeed middleware spec (inventory sync). (Oct‑16)

HNC pipeline enablers: Canva templates + Week‑3 packaging, CTA microcopy only to OPS; no sovereignty spill. 

Domain consolidation Phase‑2 (301s; canonical reggieanddro.com). (Oct‑21 RPM) 

Guardrails: medical‑claims blocklist; NIST gating; secrets guardrail; UUID map finalized. (Oct‑16, Oct‑21)

Ops minutiae: rename “lemon cherry gelato brick” folder; Gorilla Butter Cheetah Piss labels + COA follow‑up. (Oct‑XX records)

Blockers (current risks) — {Risks}
Regulatory: GA‑56 automatic license cancellation for any 21+ failure; total‑THC testing could end THCa SKUs; vape ban persists. 

Systems: MCP not yet deployed; secrets not mapped; guardrails not enforced; context crashes on huge RPM pulls (voice session). (Oct‑21, Oct‑16)

Payments: Kaja status inconsistency noted across docs; treat as red‑flag reconciliation. (Oct‑16 vs. internal prompts)

Cross‑layer leakage: HNC must not explain sovereignty stack; only CTA microcopy to OPS. 

Evidence (non‑exhaustive)
Compliance canon: THCASOP (full‑panel, NIST, CR) + R&D Master Canvas.  

Cross‑layer canon: Glue Index (allowed CTAs only). 

OPS policy: Status Box + Glossary (update discipline). 

Texas policy shift: GA‑56 emergency rules + timelines.

HNC rules: CTA microcopy; no sovereignty leakage. 

Orchestration: Rube MCP + Agent Builder deployment path.

7) TRUTH (Testable • Reproducible • Unambiguous • Traceable • High‑fidelity)
Testable (commands):

Meeting count & range

# Count meetings & show dated lines
grep -E "Meeting (Oct|started|on)" "/mnt/data/GOOGLE MEET Meetings Oct thru 10:21 AM.txt" | wc -l
grep -E "Meeting (Oct|started|on)" "/mnt/data/GOOGLE MEET Meetings Oct thru 10:21 AM.txt" | head -n 20
# Expected: 13 meetings; dates span 2025-10-02 → 2025-10-21
GA‑56 enforcement fact (21+ with zero‑tolerance) — verify in the GA‑56 brief. 

Cross‑layer rule (HNC → sovereignty only via micro‑CTA) — verify in Glue Index + HNC Master.

Compliance SOP (full‑panel/NIST/CR) — verify in R&D Master + THCASOP.

Reproducible (copy‑paste steps):

Open the source: less "/mnt/data/GOOGLE MEET Meetings Oct thru 10:21 AM.txt"

Extract “Suggested next steps”:

awk '/Suggested next steps/{flag=1;next}/^$/{flag=0}flag' "/mnt/data/GOOGLE MEET Meetings Oct thru 10:21 AM.txt"
Confirm GA‑56 language + dates in the brief. 

Unambiguous:

Meetings parsed: 13

Date range: 2025‑10‑02 → 2025‑10‑21

Unsolved items formalized: 8 (U‑1 … U‑8)

Compliance notes: “21+ ID verify; CR pack; NIST” applied wherever retail/HNC implicated.

Traceable (canon + files):

Glue Index — Cross‑layer rules. 

R&D Master Canvas + THCASOP (full‑panel/NIST/CR).

OPS Policy Status Box (update discipline). 

HNC Master Canvas (CTA microcopy only). 

Texas GA‑56 enforcement details.

Rube MCP + Agent Builder integration path. 

RPM Week Plan (Oct‑21–27). 

Transcript source: /mnt/data/GOOGLE MEET Meetings Oct thru 10:21 AM.txt

High‑fidelity:

Non‑canon web sources: None used. Policy/compliance backed by internal OPS briefs and SOPs; orchestration backed by internal PRDs and deployment canvases (citations above).

8) Compliance Flags (route issues, don’t publish detail)
Do not teach sovereignty stack in HNC; use micro‑CTA only.

All retail/HNC items: 21+ ID verify; CR packaging; validated NIST methods. 

MASTER REINTEGRATION
Delivered: One structured Markdown ingest (title/date range/meeting list); consolidated {Solved}/{Unsolved}/{Parking Lot}/{Risks}; org chart; RPM‑integrated plans for 8 unsolved items; Mermaid Gantt; Kanban CSV; TRUTH block with verification steps.

Key decisions/assumptions: Prioritized cashflow + compliance before HNC automation; mapped MCP→Agent Builder as the orchestration unlock; used canon cross‑layer rules (CTA‑only).

Memory updates: Live HANA voice is default for RPM; DSHS remediation is week‑critical; Jumio→win‑back path set; COA Checker slated post‑MCP.

Next best step: Execute U‑1/U‑2/U‑3 in order (Jumio→DSHS packet→MCP+secrets), then ship COA Checker.

Risks/blockers: GA‑56 zero‑tolerance; Kaja status inconsistency; secrets/UUID slippage; HNC sovereignty leakage risk. 

Memory usage: ~64%.
