## SUNO V5 PROMPT (Copy/Paste Ready)

```
Create a Texas trap-rap-Latin-country fusion anthem with Kill Tony rapid-fire comedy style.
BPM 140 with double-time aggressive delivery and country soul. G Major key for anthemic energy.
Male vocalist with warm Southern Texas accent, 10% auto-tune for polish, raw satirical energy.

Acoustic guitar prominent (fingerpicked intro and strumming throughout), punchy 808 bass
(warm not harsh), trap hi-hats, slide guitar accents, harmonica touches, live drums feel.
Wide stereo field, vocals clear and conversational in verses, stadium reverb on chorus
for sing-along energy. Human feel, not over-produced.

60-SECOND VERSION - EXACTLY 60 SECONDS, HARD STOP AT 1:00 MARK.

Energy arc: intimate storytelling verses (60%) building to anthemic chorus (90%) to
explosive final chorus (100%). Texas independence anthem meets grassroots political satire.
7 jokes per minute Kill Tony style punchline density.

Hook should be hypnotic and chant-ready: "BAN DAN, BAN DAN, let freedom ring!" with
crowd participation feel. Fast, funny, original.

## LYRICS FOR 60-SECOND VERSION

```
[INTRO - 8 seconds]
(Acoustic guitar fingerpicking)
"This here's a song about freedom,
And a man who don't believe in it,
They call him Dan Patrick,
But we got another name..."

[VERSE - 16 seconds]
(Trap beat drops)
"Down in Austin, there's a man in a suit and tie,
Made himself a promise, gonna tell folks what to grow,
Veterans came to testify, said 'Dan, we need this here,'
But Dan don't listen to the troopsâ€”listens to corporate bread!"

[CHORUS - 16 seconds]
(BIG anthem, sing-along)
"We don't need no Nanny State Dan,
Telling Texas folks what they can't grow on their land,
BAN DAN, BAN DAN, let freedom ring,
BAN DAN, BAN DAN, hear the people sing!"

[BRIDGE - 12 seconds]
(Pedal steel, emotional)
"150 thousand people signed against Dan's nanny ways,
2026's coming, Danâ€”the people have their say!"

[FINAL CHORUS - 8 seconds]
"BAN DAN, BAN DAN, let freedom ring!
This is TEXASâ€”we're free women and free men!"
```
