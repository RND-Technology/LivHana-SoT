5 Claude Code Skills Every Vibe Coder Needs  
	Intro  
		Claude skills have greater practical impact than MCPs (multi-click processes) because they enable more efficient and context-aware AI assistance.  
			Claude skills are progressively context-disclosed and automatically invoked, allowing seamless integration in workflows.  
			The speaker, Sean, brings real-world experience from startups and marketing companies to demonstrate grounded AI tool use.  
		The video will explain why skills are superior to MCPs or agents for certain tasks and showcase five transformative Claude skills.  
	Why use Skills?  
		Skills are highly token-efficient as they expose only needed context progressively, unlike MCPs that access external tools more broadly.  
		Skills operate directly inside the main conversation context, invoking resources only as necessary, ideal for repeatable, step-by-step procedural workflows.  
		MCPs and sub agents work in isolated sub-contexts, but skills embed consistent application of standards within the main interaction.  
		Skills teach the AI system to use its available tools in a systematic, repeatable manner, ensuring specific knowledge is applied in a defined order every time.  
		Skills excel where a systematized process or knowledge base must be reliably enforced, such as coding standards or UI guidelines.  
	How to enable Skills in Claude  
		To access Claude skills, users must first enable "skills" in Claude Desktop settings under capabilities.  
		After enabling, inside Claude Code, typing "/plugin" allows users to add skill marketplaces, which are repositories of skills.  
		For example, adding the "anthropic skills" repository from GitHub provides access to curated skills collections.  
		Installed skills require restarting Claude Code to become active.  
		The speaker plans to provide marketplace URLs in the video description for ease of access.  
	Skill Creator  
		The Skill Creator skill enables users to build new skills with proper abstraction levels, balancing general principles and concrete instructions.  
		Activated by toggling on in capabilities, it interactively asks targeted questions to gather all necessary details for skill construction.  
			Example questions include the type of component to build (e.g., React component), UI guidelines to enforce, documentation paths, and invocation examples.  
		The skill continues refining the input until it has complete information to generate a functional skill.  
		Upon completion, it outputs a zip file containing the skill folder that can be added to the Claude skills directory for immediate use.  
		For instance, a skill enforcing UI guidelines can create a searchable dropdown conforming to brand standards triggered by user commands like Command+K.  
	Brainstorming  
		The Brainstorming skill helps flesh out rough ideas into detailed plans by following a procedural, Socratic questioning method.  
		It guides users through phases: understanding, exploration, design, presentation, design documentation, and possible work tree setup or plan handoff.  
		Example use: defining what actions a command pallet should support, such as searching and opening prompts or querying version history.  
		It recursively asks questions to refine the plan, making it invaluable for vibe coders who are not professional software engineers by trade.  
		The output can be a comprehensive system design or implementation plan including requirements (functional/non-functional), architecture, component hierarchy, data flow, state management, file structure, and dependencies.  
		This detailed plan can then be handed off to other tools like Spec Kit for automated build-out.  
	Changelog Generator  
		This skill automatically generates user-friendly changelogs whenever features are committed, making it easier to track changes and communicate them to customers.  
		The changelog includes which commits were involved and the specific changes made.  
		It can be customized to produce developer-oriented changelogs with commit hashes, updated files, and technical details for internal debugging.  
		This addresses a common pain point for vibe coders who struggle to identify the origin of bugs in production due to unclear commit history.  
		The speaker demonstrates using the command pallet to search prompts and open the editor seamlessly, illustrating smooth integration.  
	Systematic Debugging  
		This debugging skill applies a four-phase framework to diagnose and fix bugs systematically: root cause investigation, pattern analysis, hypothesis testing, and implementation.  
		It aims to understand the problem fully before applying fixes, reducing trial-and-error and improving fix accuracy.  
		Particularly useful for complex bugs that are difficult to identify or reproduce.  
		The speaker shows the skill resolving an error that appeared when opening the command pallet, eliminating the bug after running the skill.  
		This skill helps vibe coders improve debugging discipline and reduce downtime.  
	Outro  
		The final skill demonstrated is the Simplification Cascade, which helps identify and reduce unnecessary complexity in code and design.  
		The skill analyzes gradients from abstract concepts to concrete applications, looking for repeated patterns and special cases that could be unified.  
		Example given: Instead of separate version history components for different contexts (prompts, agent libraries), this skill helps abstract one reusable version history manager.  
		It detects multiple independent ownership checks and caching inefficiencies in the app, proposing abstractions and optimizations for better performance and maintainability.  
		This encourages building simpler, faster, and more scalable applications by recognizing and eliminating redundant complexity.  
		The speaker invites viewers to comment if they want videos combining skills with MCP servers or additional AI workflows.
