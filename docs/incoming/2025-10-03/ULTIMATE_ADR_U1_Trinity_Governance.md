# ADR-U1: Ultimate Trinity Governance & Promotion Framework

**Status:** TIER 1 ACTIVE  
**Date:** 2025-09-28  
**Owner:** Jesse (CEO - Final Authority)  
**Architect:** Liv Hana AI EA  
**Scope:** Complete Trinity Architecture (Potential/Kinetic/Entropic) + LivHana-SoT Integration

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This ADR establishes the Ultimate Trinity Governance framework unifying Potential (LAWS/FORMS/INTEL), Kinetic (ENGINES/TOOLS/AGENTS), and Entropic (PRODUCTS/LOGS/ARTIFACTS) repositories with deterministic promotion workflows and SoT consolidation for $100K+ monthly profit optimization.

## 2. TRINITY ARCHITECTURE (CANONICAL)

### 2.1 The Source: LivHana-Potential (Logos Realm)
```
LivHana-Potential/
├── LAWS/           # Immutable governance (LAW-001 Trinity, compliance)
├── FORMS/          # Platonic templates (ADRs, PRDs, schemas)  
├── INTEL/          # Strategic intelligence (market, regulatory)
└── PRIME/          # Prime Directives & Constitutional Charter
```
**Purpose:** Pure information, unchangeable laws, platonic forms of everything that *could* exist.

### 2.2 The Engine: LivHana-Kinetic (Demiurge Realm)  
```
LivHana-Kinetic/
├── engines/        # Multi-model orchestration (router, fallback)
├── tools/          # Automation scripts (check_*, sched_*)
├── agents/         # Agentic pattern implementations  
└── workflows/      # CI/CD, deployment, monitoring
```
**Purpose:** Where Potential becomes real - functioning machinery, capabilities that act upon reality.

### 2.3 The Manifest: LivHana-Entropic (Material Realm)
```
LivHana-Entropic/  
├── products/       # Live deployments (cannabis API, payment services)
├── logs/           # Operational telemetry, audit trails
├── artifacts/      # Generated assets, snapshots, reports
└── legacy/         # Deprecated/archived implementations
```
**Purpose:** Tangible, decaying reality - specific products created by The Engine as directed by The Source.

## 3. DUAL-FLOW PROMOTION ARCHITECTURE

### 3.1 Build Flow: Potential → Kinetic → Entropic
1. **Concept** (Potential/FORMS) → **Implementation** (Kinetic/engines) → **Deployment** (Entropic/products)
2. Gates: Schema validation → Deterministic testing → Production approval
3. Artifacts: ADR → Code → Live service

### 3.2 Consolidation Flow: Entropic → Kinetic → SoT
1. **Operational Learning** (Entropic/logs) → **Process Refinement** (Kinetic/tools) → **Knowledge Integration** (SoT/docs)
2. Gates: Pattern recognition → Automation → Documentation
3. Artifacts: Telemetry → Scripts → Governance updates

## 9. PROMOTION WORKFLOW

### 9.1 Entropic → Kinetic → SoT Consolidation
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Automated analysis of Entropic/logs for operational patterns
2. **Tool Creation**: Generate Kinetic/tools scripts to automate recognized patterns  
3. **Knowledge Integration**: Update SoT documentation with proven processes
4. **Verification**: Add check_* scripts for new automated patterns
5. **Approval**: Liv Hana AI EA review → Jesse approval for constitutional impact

### 9.2 Quality Gates
- All promotions require passing verification scripts
- Cannabis compliance validation for any customer-facing changes
- Security audit for any payment/authentication changes
- Performance regression testing for any optimization changes

## 10. DECOMMISSION PROTOCOL

1. **Dependency Analysis**: Automated scan for cross-references
2. **Impact Assessment**: Business/technical risk evaluation
3. **Migration Plan**: Replacement implementation if required
4. **Soft Archive**: Move to legacy/ with 30-day pointer retention
5. **Hard Archive**: Remove pointers, update documentation
6. **Verification**: Confirm no broken dependencies

- **MTTR**: Mean Time To Recovery (< 15 minutes)
- **Compliance Drift**: Zero incidents (cannabis/payment)
- **Security Posture**: 100% secret rotation + vulnerability scanning
