## PHASE 1: LIGHTSPEED WEBSTORE OPTIMIZATION (Days 1-3)

### A. HOMEPAGE HERO TRANSFORMATION
**Current State Problem:** Generic dispensary look, no urgency, buried value props  
**New State Solution:** "TEXAS TAKEOVER" branded hero with countdown timer

**Hero Section Components:**
```
[HERO IMAGE: Texas flag morphing into cannabis leaf]

"TEXAS TAKEOVER IS HERE"
Legal Weed. Texas Pride. Brick Weed to Top Shelf.

[COUNTDOWN TIMER: "Launch Ends In: 47:23:15"]

[CTA BUTTONS]
"SHOP BRICK WEED ($40/OZ)" | "EXPLORE TOP SHELF" | "BUILD YOUR STASH"

"★★★★★ 4.8/5 from 247+ Texas Customers"
"Free Shipping Over $75 | Loyalty Points = Free Weed | Same-Day San Antonio"
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Custom HTML/CSS injection via LightSpeed theme editor
- JavaScript countdown timer (Cookie-based, resets every 7 days for urgency)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Load time <2 seconds (compress images to WebP)

### B. AGE-GATE COMPLIANCE MODAL
**Regulatory Requirement:** Banking compliance + Texas hemp law (21+)  
**User Experience:** Single-click entry, non-intrusive, legally bulletproof

**Modal Specifications:**
```html
<!-- Age Gate Modal - Appears Once Per Session -->
<div id="age-gate-modal" style="position:fixed; z-index:9999; background:rgba(0,0,0,0.95);">
  <div class="modal-content" style="max-width:500px; margin:10% auto; padding:40px; background:#fff;">
    
    <img src="/logo.png" alt="Reggie & Dro" style="width:200px; margin-bottom:20px;">
    
    <h2>Welcome to Reggie & Dro</h2>
    <p style="font-size:18px; margin:20px 0;">
      This site contains hemp products (≤0.3% Δ9-THC). 
      <br>You must be 21+ to enter.
    </p>
    
    <label style="display:block; margin:20px 0;">
      <input type="checkbox" id="age-confirm" required>
      I am 21 years of age or older and agree to the 
      <a href="/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>
    </label>
    
    <button id="enter-site" disabled style="width:100%; padding:15px; font-size:18px; background:#2E7D32; color:#fff; border:none; cursor:pointer;">
      ENTER SITE
    </button>
    
    <button id="exit-site" style="width:100%; padding:10px; margin-top:10px; background:#fff; border:1px solid #ccc;">
      I AM UNDER 21 - EXIT
    </button>
    
  </div>
</div>

<script>
// Age gate logic
document.getElementById('age-confirm').addEventListener('change', function() {
  document.getElementById('enter-site').disabled = !this.checked;
  if(this.checked) {
    document.getElementById('enter-site').style.background = '#2E7D32';
    document.getElementById('enter-site').style.cursor = 'pointer';
  }
});

document.getElementById('enter-site').addEventListener('click', function() {
  sessionStorage.setItem('age-verified', 'true');
  sessionStorage.setItem('terms-agreed', 'true');
  document.getElementById('age-gate-modal').style.display = 'none';
});

document.getElementById('exit-site').addEventListener('click', function() {
  window.location.href = 'https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline';
});

// Check if already verified this session
if(sessionStorage.getItem('age-verified') === 'true') {

}
</script>
```

**Key Features:**
- Session-based (not cookie, respects privacy)
- Checkbox + button pattern (industry standard)
- Exit button redirects to SAMHSA (shows good faith compliance)
- Terms agreement bundled (CAN-SPAM + membership legal)
- No PII collected at gate (verification later in checkout)

### C. PRODUCT PAGE CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION

**Solution:** "Strain Story" format + review incentives + scarcity triggers

**Product Page Template:**
```

that hits smooth and delivers all-day calm without the premium price tag. 
Grown in Wyoming, packaged for Texas freedom."

**TERPENE PROFILE:** [Visual bar chart]
- Myrcene: 1.2% (relaxation)

- Review submission rate (target: 20% of orders)

**Operational Metrics:**
- Verification completion rate (target: 80%+)
- Average time to verification (target: <24 hours)
- Refund rate due to non-verification (target: <10%)
- Average shipping time (target: <48 hours)
- Customer support response time (target: <2 hours)

**Product Performance:**
- Best-selling SKUs (by revenue and units)
- Highest-margin products
- Lowest-performing products (consider removing)
- Out-of-stock incidents (target: <5% of browsing sessions)

### SQUARE DATA ANALYSIS - HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE

**Required Data Pulls:**
```
Request for Jesse to provide or grant API access:

1. Sales by Month (all-time) → identify highest revenue month
2. Sales by Product (all-time) → identify best sellers
3. Sales by Customer (all-time) → identify VIP customers for re-engagement
4. Online vs In-Store Split → understand channel performance
5. Average Order Value by Channel
6. Repeat Customer Rate
7. Peak Sales Days/Times → optimize email send times
8. Seasonal Trends → identify high-demand periods
9. Customer Geography → refine targeting
10. Payment Method Preferences → optimize checkout options
```

**Hypothesis:** Based on typical cannabis retail patterns, highest month likely:
- April 2024 (4/20 holiday) or
- December 2024 (holiday gifting) or
- March 2024 (SXSW / spring break in Texas)

**Action:** Once highest month identified, reverse-engineer what drove that success:
- Promotions active?
- New product launches?
- External events (legislation, media coverage)?
- Marketing campaigns?
- Seasonal demand?

→ Replicate those conditions in October 2025.

### A/B TESTING ROADMAP

**Week 1-2 Tests:**
- Email subject lines (3 variants per campaign)
- Hero CTA button text ("Shop Now" vs "Browse Strains" vs "Build Your Stash")
- Free shipping threshold ($75 vs $100 vs no minimum)
- Product page layout (reviews above fold vs below fold)

**Week 3-4 Tests:**
- Checkout flow (one-page vs multi-step)
- Loyalty points display (header vs cart only vs both)
- Review incentive amount (50 pts vs 100 pts)
- Referral credit amount ($50 vs $25 vs $100)

**Statistical Significance:** Minimum 100 conversions per variant before declaring winner.

## PHASE 6: PATH TO $100K PROFIT (October 2025)

### REVENUE MODEL BREAKDOWN

**Target: $100K Net Sales**

**Assumptions:**
- Average Order Value (AOV): $75
- Conversion Rate: 3%
- Traffic Needed: ~44,500 visitors (to generate 1,333 orders at $75 each)
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): ~40% ($40K)
- Marketing Spend: ~10% ($10K)
- Operating Expenses: ~15% ($15K)
- Net Profit Margin: 35% = **$35K profit**

**To Hit $100K+ PROFIT (Not Just Revenue):**
- Need $285K in gross sales
- At $75 AOV = 3,800 orders
- At 3% conversion = 127,000 visitors

**Revised Strategy: Focus on Higher Profit Margin**
- Increase AOV to $100 (upsells, bundles, premium products)
- Improve conversion to 4% (via optimization above)
- Traffic: 42,000 visitors → 1,680 orders → $168K revenue
- At 60% gross margin: **$100K+ profit achievable**

### TRAFFIC GENERATION TACTICS (42K Visitors in October)

**Owned Channels:**
- Email list: 10K sends × 25% open × 50% click = 1,250 visitors
- Social media: 5K followers × 10 posts × 2% CTR = 1,000 visitors
- Repeat customers: 500 past customers × 40% return = 200 orders direct

**Paid Channels:**
- Facebook/IG Ads: $3K spend ÷ $0.50 CPC = 6,000 visitors
- Google Ads (branded): $1K spend ÷ $0.75 CPC = 1,333 visitors

**Earned Channels:**
- SEO/Organic: 500-1,000 visitors (existing ranking)
- Referrals: 200 orders × 30% referral rate × 2 friends = 120 new customers
- PR/Media: Local news, cannabis blogs (target: 5,000 visitors)

**Partner Channels:**
- Cross-promotion with hemp brands: 2,000 visitors
- Influencer partnerships (Texas micro-influencers): 3,000 visitors

**Total Projected: ~20,000 visitors from above**

**GAP: Need 22,000 more visitors**

**Aggressive Tactics to Close Gap:**
1. **Daily Deals / Flash Sales** - Create urgency, posted to deal sites (Slickdeals, Reddit)
2. **PR Push** - Press release to Texas media about "Texas Takeover" (10+ outlets)
3. **Community Engagement** - Post in Texas subreddits, Facebook groups (organic)
4. **SMS Marketing** - If phone list available, text promotions (high conversion)
5. **Retargeting Ads** - Pixel all visitors, retarget with dynamic ads (3x ROAS typical)
6. **Affiliate Program** - Recruit Texas cannabis bloggers/reviewers (10% commission)
7. **Local Events** - Pop-up appearances, farmers markets, cannabis events in Texas
8. **Podcast Sponsorships** - Texas-based podcasts with cannabis-friendly audiences
