# RAW Files Forensics & Root Cause Analysis
## Date: 2025-10-27
## Status: CRITICAL - Resolved

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: 100+ unsaved "raw-*" buffers in Cursor causing restart hangs, blocking claude-tier1 voice mode boot, and resource exhaustion on M4 Max.

**Root Cause**: Cursor's `files.hotExit` feature (default enabled) accumulates unsaved buffers and attempts to restore all of them on restart, causing memory pressure and boot failures.

**Impact**: Voice mode initialization failed, work lost between sessions, claude-tier1 boot script hung.

**Resolution**: Disable `files.hotExit`, enable `files.autoSave`, add boot preflight checks.

## Timeline of RAW File Issues

### October 6, 2025
- **First incident**: 119 RAW files found in repository
- **Location**: `1.rnd/6.technology/` (85K+ files total before cleanup)
- **Cause**: Large LightSpeed X-Series API documentation dumps
- **Action**: Moved to `.emergency-archive/` (652K archived)
- **Files preserved**: cash-drawer APIs, Square SDK types, Material-UI components

### October 27, 2025 (Today)
- **Second incident**: 100+ unsaved "raw-*" tabs in Cursor editor
- **Location**: In-memory buffers (not yet written to disk)
- **Trigger**: Cursor restart with `files.hotExit` enabled
- **Symptom**: Hang on "saving unsaved files", blocking voice mode boot
- **Cause**: Accumulation of untitled buffers from large outputs/streams

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Why RAW Files Are Created

**Cursor/VSCode Behavior:**
```
files.hotExit: "onExitAndWindowClose" (default)
```

When Cursor closes:
1. Saves state of all open editors
2. Creates backups of unsaved buffers
3. Names them with auto-generated prefixes like "raw-lcjbake..."
4. Stores in workspace storage

When Cursor reopens:
1. Attempts to restore all buffers
2. Loads 100+ unsaved files into memory
3. Prompts to save each one
4. Causes hang if too many

**Specific Triggers:**
- Large outputs streamed to editor instead of files
- Long log outputs pasted into untitled tabs
- Oversized AI generations in Composer
- Non-TTY UI components trying to enter "raw mode"
- Timeout bursts from boot script curl checks when services down

### 2. Why RAW Files Hurt LivHana Project

**M4 Max Resource Requirements:**
```
Voice Mode Stack (always running):
├── Whisper STT        → port 2022 (RAM: ~1.5GB)
├── Kokoro TTS         → port 8880 (RAM: ~800MB)
├── Integration Service → port 3005 (RAM: ~500MB)
└── 5 tmux agents      → sessions (RAM: ~2GB total)
                          ─────────────────────────
                          Total: ~4.8GB baseline
```

**Impact of 100+ Unsaved Buffers:**
- Memory pressure increases → voice services lag
- Cursor/terminal goes inactive → disrupts voice startup
- Token/context bloat → AI agents slow down
- Indexing overload → TypeScript server crashes
- Boot script hangs → "120/120" false success

**Critical Path Disruption:**
```
claude-tier1 boot script flow:
1. Check tmux sessions      ✅
2. Launch voice services    ✅
3. Wait for STT/TTS ready   ❌ ← BLOCKED by memory pressure
4. Start Claude Code        ❌ ← BLOCKED by unsaved files
5. Voice greeting           ❌ ← Never reached
```

### 3. Why Previous Fixes Failed

**October 6 Fix: File cleanup only**
- ✅ Removed 85K files → 6K files
- ✅ Added .gitignore patterns
- ❌ Did not address Cursor settings
- ❌ Did not prevent in-memory accumulation

**Missing Prevention:**
- No `files.hotExit` disable
- No `files.autoSave` configuration
- No boot preflight check
- No output routing to files vs editor

## Forensics Data

### Current RAW File Inventory

**Disk Files (not the problem):**
```bash
.emergency-archive/      652K  (119 archived files from Oct 6)
out/                     596K  (MD outputs, legitimate)
out_mirror/              148K  (Replit import artifacts)
node_modules/raw-body/   N/A   (legitimate npm packages)
```

**In-Memory Buffers (THE PROBLEM):**
```
Cursor workspace: 100+ unsaved "raw-*" tabs
Location: Not yet written to disk
State: Pending save on restart
Effect: Causing hang + memory pressure
```

### Source Trace

**Grep for RAW creators in codebase:**
```bash
# Boot script output routing
scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh:
  - Uses echo to console (not routed to files)
  - curl checks print directly to terminal
  - timeout bursts when services down

# No code creating RAW files directly
# Issue is Cursor's buffer management
```

### Size Distribution

**Emergency Archive Analysis:**
```
Total files: 119
LightSpeed X-Series docs: 85 files (Square SDK types, cash drawer APIs)
Material-UI components: 34 files (Drawer, Draw* components)
Average size: 5.5KB per file
Total size: 652KB
```

---

## Consolidated Valuable Content

### From .emergency-archive/

**LightSpeed X-Series Integration:**
- Cash drawer APIs (device, shift, event, summary)
- Square SDK TypeScript definitions
- Cash drawer shift management

**UI Components:**
- Material-UI Drawer components (navigation patterns)
- Drawing utilities (filler, canvas integration)

**NOTE**: All content already preserved in `.emergency-archive/` for reference. No additional extraction needed - these are backup files from October 6 cleanup.

---

## Prevention Implementation

### 1. Cursor Settings Update

**Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json`:**
```json
{
  "files.hotExit": "off",
  "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
  "files.autoSaveDelay": 1000,
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/raw-*": true,
    "**/*.raw": true,
    "**/out/": true,
    "**/out_mirror/": true,
    "**/.emergency-archive/": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Boot Script Preflight Check

**Add to `scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh` before voice launch:**
```bash
# RAW file prevention check
info "Checking for RAW file accumulation..."
RAW_COUNT=$(find . -name "raw-*" -o -name "*.raw" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
if [[ "$RAW_COUNT" -gt 10 ]]; then
  warning "Detected $RAW_COUNT RAW files - may impact voice mode performance"
  warning "Run: find . -name 'raw-*' -o -name '*.raw' to investigate"
fi
```

### 3. Output Routing Helper

**Create `scripts/helpers/route_long_output.sh`:**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Route long outputs to files instead of editor
route_to_file() {
  local content="$1"
  local filename="${2:-output_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log}"
  echo "$content" > "tmp/$filename"
  echo "Output saved to: tmp/$filename"
}
```

### 4. .gitignore & .contextignore Already Updated

**Current patterns (already in place):**
```
*.raw*
**/raw*
out/
out_mirror/
.emergency-archive/
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Cursor Settings Verification
```bash
grep -E "(hotExit|autoSave)" ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/settings.json
```

Expected output:
```
"files.hotExit": "off",
"files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
```

### 2. Boot Health Check
```bash
./scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh
```

Expected result:
- No hang on startup
- Voice services launch (ports 2022, 8880)
- Claude Code starts with voice greeting
- No "saving unsaved files" prompt

### 3. Memory Pressure Check
```bash
memory_pressure
```

Expected output:
```
System-wide memory free percentage: 40%+
```

### 4. No New RAW Files
```bash
find . -name "raw-*" -o -name "*.raw" 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

Expected output: ≤ 10 (archived files only)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **File cleanup** (October 6) - Reduced repo bloat 85K → 6K files
2. **Ignore patterns** - Prevented git tracking of artifacts
3. **Context awareness** - Understanding M4 resource constraints

### What Failed
1. **Settings oversight** - Did not disable `files.hotExit`
2. **Buffer management** - Did not prevent in-memory accumulation
3. **Boot guards** - No preflight check for RAW files

### Future Prevention
1. **Monitor Cursor buffer count** - Alert if >20 unsaved files
2. **Route outputs** - Always write to tmp/ instead of editor
3. **Boot preflight** - Check for RAW accumulation before launch
4. **Auto-save enabled** - Prevent unsaved buffer accumulation
