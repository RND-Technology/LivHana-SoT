### 3.1. Dashboard Vision

This dashboard is a "CRM in one view," designed for a mobile-first user. It provides a highly visual, map-based interface to manage the shop network, track samples, and monitor the sales pipeline, with a strong emphasis on voice commands for hands-free operation.

### 3.2. Feature Requirements

-   **20 Shop Network Map**:
    -   A full-width, interactive 5x4 grid of shop "cards."
    -   Each card is color-coded by status (Green for active, Orange for pending).
    -   Clicking a card reveals detailed information: contact info, samples delivered, sales data, and visit notes.
-   **Sample Tracking Panel**:
    -   Lists all product samples (e.g., Permanent Marker, Pink Suits).
    -   Shows units distributed, COA status (Ready/Pending), and which shops have received them.
-   **Deal Pipeline Panel**:
    -   A Kanban-style board showing bulk buyer deals.
    -   Tracks deals by stage (e.g., Warm, Negotiation, Sample Review).
    -   Displays the total potential value of the pipeline.
-   **Revenue Attribution Panel**:
    -   Shows monthly revenue generated from active shops.
    -   Displays projected revenue once all 20 shops are active.
-   **Quick Actions**:
    -   Buttons for common tasks: "Log Shop Visit," "Request Sample Shipment," "Download COA," "Contact Ryan Bologna (KCA)."
-   **Voice Integration**:
    -   Must support commands like "Liv, update Shop 07 to active," "Liv, when is Delta Drink COA ready?," and "Liv, log visit to Shop 03," which should trigger voice-to-text note capture.

### 3.3. Access & Views

-   **Access Level**: Full access to his own network data. Read-only access to high-level inventory status.
-   **Views**: The primary view is the interactive map. He can drill down into individual shop details and deal information.

## 4. PDR/ADR (Planning & Decisions)

-   **PDRs (Product Design Requirements)**:
    -   **PDR-004: Mobile-First, Voice-First**: The interface must be optimized for mobile use, and all core functions must be accessible via voice for hands-free operation.
    -   **PDR-005: Geospatial Visualization**: The primary view for managing the shop network must be a map or a visual grid, not a table.
-   **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)**:
    -   **ADR-003: Centralized CRM Data Model**: A single data model must be created to unify shop information, sample tracking, and deal pipelines to power the dashboard.

## 5. QA & Red Team Strategy

-   **QA Focus**:
    -   **Voice-to-Text Accuracy**: Test the accuracy of note-taking via voice commands in various noisy environments (e.g., in a car).
    -   **Map Interactivity**: Ensure the map/grid interface is fast and responsive on mobile devices.
    -   **Data Sync**: Verify that status updates made via voice (e.g., "update Shop 07 to active") are reflected in the database and on the dashboard in real-time.
-   **Red Team Scenarios**:
    -   **Scenario 1: Location Spoofing**: Attempt to feed false GPS data to the system to disrupt location-based features or reporting.
    -   **Scenario 2: Pipeline Manipulation**: Try to alter deal stages or values in the pipeline to create a false impression of sales performance.
    -   **Scenario 3: Unauthorized COA Access**: Attempt to access or modify Certificate of Analysis documents.
