## ‚úÖ Working

- Voice service ElevenLabs proxy with JWT guardrails, queue hand-off, and shared logging
- DeepSeek reasoning gateway with guardrail enforcement, memory & feedback logging (unit tests green)
- Deterministic Playwright voice-mode test using Redis mock payload helper (skips when `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` unset)
- Markdown lint auto-fix pass (`markdownlint-cli2`) applied across docs
- Docker stack builds locally with voice-service/reasoning-gateway + DeepSeek stub (runtime env inject resolves JWT secrets; health script green)
