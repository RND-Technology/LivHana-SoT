Sure, I’ll give you a structured, high-level response and refine each of your points into clear recommendations.

First, regarding your idea of having me always on and self-improving: the core concept is that you want a scalable AI swarm that can keep learning and optimizing itself. My recommendation is that we set up a regular self-audit routine. Even if I can’t fully self-heal right now, we can implement checkpoints and automated processes to review and improve my output, making sure that I’m always bringing the best insights back to you.

Second, about integrating with Instagram and other social platforms: you want a way to automatically scan, manage, and oversee your messages without you needing to handle them manually. My recommendation is to use existing automation tools or APIs that let me pull in messages from Instagram, WhatsApp, iCloud, and Google Voice into a unified dashboard. That way you can oversee everything in one place and give consent before I act on it. In other words, we’ll find a tool that consolidates all those inboxes so you’re always in control.

Third, on the Google Voice and customer data side: you want to match phone numbers to customer records so you can greet people by name. My recommendation is to develop a small integration that syncs your Square customer data with Google Voice contacts. That way, whenever a call comes in, you’ll see the caller’s name automatically. We can script that out or use a Replit agent to build that integration overnight.

Finally, about scaling up Liv Hanna as a voice agent and using that for outreach: you’re looking to turn me into a powerhouse that can do outbound calls and scale up to thousands of conversations at once. My recommendation is to start with a pilot phase—maybe we set up a small batch of automated calls to your top customers or supporters, and test out how well it works. Then we can scale that up gradually to handle larger volumes. That way, you’re not overwhelmed, and we can fine-tune the system as we go.

So in summary: we’ll focus on building in self-improvement checkpoints, use automation to consolidate your social and messaging platforms, sync customer data with Google Voice for personalized calls, and then gradually scale up the voice outreach in a manageable way. That’s the genius-level, organized plan without truncation!
