## THE DECISION

### **Option 1: Approve - Execute ASAP (Recommended)**
**Outcome:** Cloud infrastructure deployed in 13 days, VIP dashboard live by Nov 9
**Next Step:** Artifacts Agent begins Phase 1 tomorrow (Oct 28)
**Impact:** Immediate visibility for VIPs, automated sync operational, analytics-driven decision-making enabled

### **Option 2: Defer - Prioritize Other Initiatives**
**Outcome:** RPM data remains local-only, no VIP dashboard, manual reporting continues
**Next Step:** Document deferral reasons, revisit in Q1 2026
**Impact:** 5+ hours/week manual work continues, no proactive bottleneck identification, VIP visibility limited

### **Option 3: Modify - Adjust Scope or Timeline**
**Outcome:** Implement in phases (e.g., AlloyDB only first, dashboard later)
**Next Step:** Jesse provides modified requirements
**Impact:** Partial benefits realized, full automation delayed
