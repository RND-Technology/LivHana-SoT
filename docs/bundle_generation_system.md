# Unified Bundle Generation System

## Complete Context Aggregation for Development Phases

### Purpose: Create comprehensive, phase-ready context packages from captured session data

## Bundle Types & Triggers

### 1. Phase Transition Bundles

**Generated**: At completion of each R&D phase
**Contains**: All context from current phase + cumulative learning
**Format**: `phase_[N]_complete_bundle_YYYYMMDD.md`

### 2. Crisis Response Bundles  

**Generated**: When high-priority issues identified
**Contains**: All relevant context for immediate problem-solving
**Format**: `crisis_response_[issue]_YYYYMMDD.md`

### 3. Weekly Progress Bundles

**Generated**: Every Sunday, project status compilation
**Contains**: Week's progress, blockers, next actions
**Format**: `weekly_bundle_[week_of]_YYYYMMDD.md`

### 4. Stakeholder Communication Bundles

**Generated**: Before major stakeholder interactions
**Contains**: Relevant history, current status, projected outcomes
**Format**: `stakeholder_[type]_bundle_YYYYMMDD.md`

## Bundle Generation Process

### Phase 1: Data Aggregation

1. **Session Harvest Collection**: All captured conversations, voice notes, canvases
2. **Behavioral Snapshot Integration**: Latest personality and capability updates  
3. **Memory Update Compilation**: Context changes and new information
4. **Priority Reassessment**: Current urgency levels and timeline pressures

### Phase 2: Context Synthesis

1. **Timeline Integration**: How current context fits development phases
2. **Stakeholder Impact Analysis**: Who needs what information when
3. **Technical Requirement Mapping**: Development needs and constraints
4. **Success Criteria Validation**: Progress toward established metrics

### Phase 3: Bundle Formatting

1. **Executive Summary**: Key points for rapid consumption
2. **Detailed Context**: Complete information for development teams
3. **Action Items**: Specific next steps and accountability
4. **Integration Points**: How bundle connects to other systems
