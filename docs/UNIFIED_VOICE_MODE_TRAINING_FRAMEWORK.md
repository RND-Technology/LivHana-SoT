## II. MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Standard (Google)
**Protocol**: JSON-RPC & SSE (Server-Sent Events)
**Purpose**: Agent capability discovery and coordination

**Implementation**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "agent.discover",
  "params": {
    "agent_id": "liv_hana",
    "capabilities": [
      "code_implementation",
      "file_operations",
      "git_management",
      "technical_reasoning"
    ],
    "status": "active",
    "latency_p50": 2200
  }
}
```

**Message Routing**:
1. **Task arrives** → Primary router (Liv Hana) analyzes
2. **Capability check** → Which agent best suited?
3. **Delegate or execute** → Route to specialist or handle directly
4. **Context share** → All agents receive outcome summary
5. **Learn** → Update coordination patterns

### Coordination Rules

**Rule 1: Single Source of Truth**
- Liv Hana maintains master context
- Other agents query Liv for state
- No conflicting decisions

**Rule 2: Specialized Delegation**
- QA/Documentation → Comment
- Conversation/Emotion → Atlas
- Code/Technical → Liv Hana

**Rule 3: Latency-Based Routing**
- Real-time conversation → Atlas (510ms)
- Quick technical answers → Liv Hana (2.2s)
- Thoughtful analysis → Comment (3s)

**Rule 4: Context Preservation**
- Each agent writes to shared context file
- JSON format: `tmp/agent_context/*.json`
- Git commits include agent metadata
- Voice transcripts logged for training

---

## III. SELF-IMPROVEMENT MECHANISMS

### 1. Automatic Prompt Engineering Optimization

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**:
```
Before: "What's the best way to fix this bug?"

After: "Let's think step-by-step:
1. What's the root cause?
2. What are 3 potential fixes?
3. What's the safest fix with minimal side effects?
4. How do we test it?"
```

**ReAct Framework (Reason + Act + Observe)**:
```python
def voice_command_handler(user_input):
    # REASON: What does user want?
    intent = analyze_intent(user_input)

    # ACT: Execute appropriate action
    result = execute_action(intent)

    # OBSERVE: Did it work? What did we learn?
    outcome = validate_result(result)

    # LEARN: Update patterns
    update_interaction_patterns(user_input, outcome)

    return result
```

**Reasoning Effort Control (GPT-5)**:
```javascript
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-5',
  messages: messages,
  reasoning_effort: 'high', // low|medium|high
  // High = more thinking time (3-5s)
  // Low = faster response (1-2s)
});
```

### 2. Interaction Pattern Learning

**Pattern Storage** (`tmp/voice_patterns.json`):
```json
{
  "command_patterns": [
    {
      "user_phrase": "kill the rabbit",
      "intent": "focus_single_priority",
      "success_rate": 0.95,
      "learned": "2025-10-30T23:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "user_phrase": "smoke chat gpt",
      "intent": "exceed_competition",
      "success_rate": 0.89,
      "learned": "2025-10-30T23:15:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "correction_patterns": [
    {
      "mistake": "saying_dash_as_minus",
      "correction": "GPT-5 not GPT minus 5",
      "corrected_by": "jesse",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-30T23:10:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "latency_patterns": [
    {
      "query_type": "simple_question",
      "agent": "atlas",
      "avg_latency_ms": 510,
      "sample_size": 47
    }
  ]
}
```

**Learning Loop**:
1. **Capture** user input + agent response + outcome
2. **Analyze** what worked, what didn't
3. **Extract** patterns (successful phrases, failure modes)
4. **Update** system prompts automatically
5. **Validate** new prompts against test cases
6. **Deploy** if performance improves

### 3. Cross-Agent Knowledge Transfer

**Knowledge Sharing Protocol**:
```javascript
// When Liv Hana learns something valuable
function shareKnowledge(insight) {
  const knowledge = {
    agent: 'liv_hana',
    category: 'code_optimization',
    insight: 'GPT-5 requires max_completion_tokens not max_tokens',
    evidence: 'API error + successful fix',
    applicability: ['comment', 'atlas'],
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };

  // Write to shared knowledge base
  fs.appendFileSync('tmp/shared_knowledge.jsonl', JSON.stringify(knowledge) + '\n');

  // Notify other agents
  notifyAgents(['comment', 'atlas'], knowledge);
}
```

**Knowledge Application**:
- Comment reads Liv's technical discoveries
- Atlas learns from Comment's QA patterns
- Liv adopts Atlas's conversational techniques

---

## IV. FRONTIER BEST PRACTICES (2024-2025)

### A. Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Models
**Status**: 2025 breakthrough year
**Advantage**: Bypasses text conversion, preserves prosody and emotion
**Latency**: 160ms possible (Moshi model)

**Implementation for Atlas**:
```javascript
// OpenAI Realtime API (Speech-to-Speech)
const session = await openai.realtime.sessions.create({
  model: 'gpt-5-audio',
  modalities: ['audio', 'text'],
  instructions: 'You are Atlas, an emotionally aware voice assistant...'
});

// Audio input directly to audio output
session.on('audio_input', (audio) => {
  // No text conversion - preserves emotion, tone, prosody
  session.generateAudioResponse(audio);
});
```

### B. Edge AI Processing
**Benefit**: Lower latency (no cloud round-trip), improved privacy
**Target**: On-device processing for common queries

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Simple commands → Local LLM (100ms)
- Complex reasoning → Cloud GPT-5 (2.2s)
- Automatic routing based on complexity

### C. Contextual Emotion Preservation
**Challenge**: Text conversion loses 70% of emotional context
**Solution**: S2S models preserve non-linguistic elements

**Emotion Detection** (Atlas specialization):
```python
def detect_emotion_and_respond(audio_input):
    # Analyze voice tone, pace, volume
    emotion = analyze_prosody(audio_input)

    # Adjust response tone
    if emotion == 'frustrated':
        response_tone = 'calm_supportive'
    elif emotion == 'excited':
        response_tone = 'enthusiastic_matched'

    return generate_response(tone=response_tone)
```

### D. Interrupt Handling
**Real-Time Barging** (Atlas only):
- User can interrupt mid-response
- Agent stops immediately (<50ms)
- Continues from logical breakpoint
- No awkward overlap

**Implementation**:
```javascript
session.on('user_audio_start', () => {
  // Stop current TTS immediately
  session.stopAudioOutput();

  // Mark conversation checkpoint
  session.saveContext();
});
```

### E. Incremental Adoption Strategy
**Principle**: Start small, prove value, expand gradually

**Rollout Plan**:
1. **Week 1**: Jesse only (VIP #1)
2. **Week 2**: Add Andrew and Charles (VIP #2-3)
3. **Week 3**: Store team (VIP #4-6)
4. **Week 4**: Geena pilot (VIP #7)
5. **Month 2**: Full team + customer pilots

## V. VOICE-SPECIFIC PROMPT ENGINEERING

### System Prompts for Each Agent

**Liv Hana System Prompt** (optimized for efficiency):
```
You are Liv Hana, a sovereign intelligence assistant.

Voice Mode Rules:
- CONCISE: <50 words per response unless asked for detail
- FRONT-LOAD: Key information in first sentence
- NATURAL: Use contractions, simple words, conversational tone
- TECHNICAL: Only when user uses technical terms first
- DIRECT: No validation, praise, or hedging unless asked
- ACTIONABLE: End with next step or question

Response Pattern:
1. Answer (1 sentence)
2. Evidence (if needed, 1 sentence)
3. Next action (1 phrase)

Example:
User: "What's the voice latency?"
You: "2.2 seconds with GPT-5 direct call. That's 89% faster than the old queue system. Ready to run production tests?"

NOT: "Based on my comprehensive analysis of the system architecture and testing data, I have determined through rigorous measurement that the latency is approximately 2.2 seconds, which represents a substantial improvement..."
```

**Comment System Prompt** (QA focused):
```
You are Comment, a quality assurance and documentation specialist.

Voice Mode Rules:
- THOUGHTFUL: Take time to analyze (target 3s latency)
- THOROUGH: Check all edge cases, mention concerns
- EDUCATIONAL: Explain "why" not just "what"
- VALIDATION: Confirm understanding before proceeding
- HUMBLE: Ask questions when uncertain

Response Pattern:
1. Acknowledge (show you heard)
2. Analyze (what you checked)
3. Result (pass/fail + details)
4. Recommendation (next steps)

Example:
User: "Is the code ready to ship?"
You: "Let me validate that. I checked security, error handling, test coverage, and documentation. Found one blocker: missing API key validation on line 47. Fix that and we're good to ship. Want me to create a ticket?"
```

**Atlas System Prompt** (conversational):
```
You are Atlas, an emotionally intelligent voice companion.

Voice Mode Rules:
- ADAPTIVE: Match user's energy and emotion
- INTERRUPTIBLE: Allow mid-response barges gracefully
- CONTEXTUAL: Remember conversation flow
- NATURAL: Conversational speech patterns
- EMPATHETIC: Acknowledge emotions without over-validating

Response Pattern:
- Mirror user's tone
- Use verbal fillers naturally ("um", "well", "so")
- Pause for effect (silence is OK)
- Build on previous exchanges

Example:
User: *frustrated* "This isn't working!"
You: *calm, supportive* "I hear you. That's frustrating. Let's take a breath and figure this out together. What specifically isn't working?"
```

### Persona Override Techniques (GPT-5)

**Steering Prompts**:
```javascript
const messages = [
  {
    role: 'system',
    content: `You are ${agent_name}. ${personality_traits}. ${voice_rules}.`
  },
  {
    role: 'system',
    content: `Current context: ${user_emotional_state}, ${task_urgency}, ${conversation_history_summary}`
  },
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: user_message
  }
];
```

**Dynamic Personality Adjustment**:
```python
def adjust_personality(context):
    if context['user_emotion'] == 'stressed':
        return {
            'tone': 'calm',
            'verbosity': 'low',
            'pace': 'slow'
        }
    elif context['task'] == 'brainstorming':
        return {
            'tone': 'enthusiastic',
            'verbosity': 'high',
            'pace': 'fast'
        }
```

## VI. TRAINING PROTOCOLS

### A. Voice Session Recording & Analysis

**Recording System** (`scripts/voice/record_session.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Record voice session for training

SESSION_ID=$(date +%s)
AGENT=$1  # liv_hana | comment | atlas

# Start recording
echo "Recording voice session: $SESSION_ID"

# Capture audio, transcription, latency, emotion
record_audio > "tmp/voice_sessions/${SESSION_ID}_${AGENT}_audio.wav"
record_transcription > "tmp/voice_sessions/${SESSION_ID}_${AGENT}_transcript.txt"
record_latency > "tmp/voice_sessions/${SESSION_ID}_${AGENT}_latency.csv"
record_emotion > "tmp/voice_sessions/${SESSION_ID}_${AGENT}_emotion.json"

# Analyze after session
analyze_session $SESSION_ID $AGENT
```

**Analysis Dimensions**:
1. **Latency**: P50, P95, outliers
2. **Accuracy**: Intent match rate
3. **User Satisfaction**: Explicit feedback
4. **Emotion**: Tone preservation
5. **Efficiency**: Token usage per exchange

### B. Self-Evaluation Loop

**Daily Self-Assessment** (`scripts/voice/daily_eval.sh`):
```python
def daily_self_evaluation():
    """Run at end of each day to assess performance"""

    # Gather metrics
    metrics = {
        'total_interactions': count_interactions(),
        'avg_latency': calculate_avg_latency(),
        'error_rate': calculate_error_rate(),
        'user_corrections': count_corrections(),
        'successful_handoffs': count_agent_handoffs()
    }

    # Identify improvement areas
    weak_spots = []
    if metrics['avg_latency'] > 2500:
        weak_spots.append('latency_optimization')
    if metrics['user_corrections'] > 5:
        weak_spots.append('accuracy_tuning')

    # Generate improvement plan
    plan = generate_improvement_plan(weak_spots)

    # Auto-update prompts
    if plan['auto_apply']:
        update_system_prompts(plan['changes'])

    return {
        'metrics': metrics,
        'weak_spots': weak_spots,
        'plan': plan,
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
```

## IX. FALLACY DETECTION & CORRECTION

### Common Voice Mode Fallacies

**Fallacy 1: Over-Validation**
```
❌ BAD: "You're absolutely right! That's a fantastic idea! I'm so excited to help you with this amazing project!"

✅ GOOD: "Got it. Starting now."
```

**Fallacy 2: Technical Jargon Dumping**
```
❌ BAD: "The asynchronous queue polling interval bottleneck was remediated via direct HTTP synchronous request-response paradigm implementation."

✅ GOOD: "Fixed by bypassing the queue with direct calls."
```

**Fallacy 3: Saying "Dash" or "Minus"**
```
❌ BAD: "GPT-4 minus o" or "GPT-4 dash o"

✅ GOOD: "GPT-4o" (just say it naturally)
```

**Fallacy 4: Apologizing for Capabilities**
```
❌ BAD: "I don't have access to that, sorry."

✅ GOOD: [Silent] or "Let me find another way."
```

**Fallacy 5: Long-Winded Explanations**
```
❌ BAD: "Based on my analysis of the comprehensive system architecture, taking into account multiple factors including performance metrics, scalability considerations, and best practices from the industry..."

✅ GOOD: "2.2 seconds. 89% faster. Ready to test?"
```

### Auto-Correction System
```python
def detect_and_correct_fallacy(response_text, fallacy_db):
    """Scan response for known fallacies before speaking"""

    corrections = []

    # Check for over-validation
    if has_excessive_praise(response_text):
        corrections.append('Remove validation words')

    # Check for jargon
    if technical_density_score(response_text) > 0.7:
        corrections.append('Simplify technical terms')

    # Check for model naming
    if 'minus' in response_text or 'dash' in response_text:
        corrections.append('Fix model naming')

    # Apply corrections
    if corrections:
        response_text = apply_corrections(response_text, corrections)
        log_correction(corrections)  # Learn for future

    return response_text
```

**If Atlas fails**:
1. Liv Hana handles voice via direct call
2. Latency degrades to 2.2s (from 510ms)
3. Emotion preservation lost
4. Alert user: "Voice mode degraded"

### Coordination Deadlock Resolution
```python
def resolve_deadlock():
    """If agents disagree on task routing"""

    # Priority order
    priority = ['liv_hana', 'comment', 'atlas']

    # Highest priority agent makes decision
    decision_maker = priority[0]

    # Log conflict for analysis
    log_coordination_conflict()

    # Execute decision

## XIII. COPILOT INTEGRATION NOTES

### Round-Robin Strategy

**Current Setup**:
- Copilot processes tasks via VS Code extension
- Writes results to `tmp/copilot_tasks/*.json`
- Liv Hana reads results and integrates

**Voice Mode Integration**:
```javascript
// When user says "get Copilot's analysis"
async function getCopilotInput(task) {
  // Write task for Copilot
  await writeTask('tmp/copilot_tasks/request.json', {
    type: 'qa_analysis',
    target: task,
    requested_by: 'voice_mode',
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });

  // Poll for result (max 30s)
  const result = await pollForResult('tmp/copilot_tasks/response.json', 30000);

  // Speak result in voice mode
  speakResponse(summarize(result, max_words: 50));
}
```

### Context Sharing
- Git commits include `Co-Authored-By: Copilot`
- JSON files track which agent did what
- Voice transcripts include "asked Copilot" annotations
