# üöö LOCAL DELIVERY INTEGRATION - SATX MARKET TAKEOVER

**Mission:** Launch same-day delivery for ReggieAndDro.com to compete with Farmacy, HighWay, SACC
**Priority:** CRITICAL (identified as Gap #2 in SATX competitor analysis)
**Timeline:** 7-14 days to full operational delivery
**Expected Impact:** +30-50% revenue, massive market share gain

---

## üéØ THE OPPORTUNITY

### Current SATX Delivery Market
| Competitor | Delivery Model | Pricing | Speed | Our Advantage |
|------------|----------------|---------|-------|---------------|
| **Farmacy Botanical** | Delivery-only | ~$10/g | Same-day | ‚úÖ We have storefront + social club |
| **HighWay SA** | Delivery-focused | Mid-range | Same-day | ‚úÖ We have community & brand (HNC) |
| **SACC** | Delivery-only | Mid-range | Same-day | ‚úÖ We have in-person experience |
| **Canniversal** | In-store + delivery | Premium | Same-day | ‚úÖ We're more affordable |

**The Gap:** Most competitors are EITHER delivery-only OR in-store. You can offer BOTH + social club + HNC content.

**The Strategy:** Hybrid model dominance - "Shop in-store, order online, enjoy at the lounge"

**Function:**
```javascript
// Sync Lightspeed orders ‚Üí DoorDash Drive API

const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');

const deliveryRouter = express.Router();

// Lightspeed webhook: new order created
deliveryRouter.post('/webhook/lightspeed/new-order', async (req, res) => {
    const order = req.body;

    // Check if delivery order
    if (order.deliveryType === 'delivery') {
        // Create DoorDash Drive delivery
        const doordashOrder = {
            external_delivery_id: order.orderId,
            pickup_address: 'YOUR_STORE_ADDRESS',
            pickup_phone: 'YOUR_STORE_PHONE',
            dropoff_address: order.customerAddress,
            dropoff_phone: order.customerPhone,
            order_value: order.total,
            tip: order.tip || 0,
            items: order.items.map(item => ({
                name: item.name,
                quantity: item.quantity,
                price: item.price
            }))
        };

        const response = await axios.post(
            'https://openapi.doordash.com/drive/v2/deliveries',
            doordashOrder,
            {
                headers: {
                    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.DOORDASH_API_KEY}`,
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
                }
            }
        );

        res.json({ success: true, deliveryId: response.data.id });
    } else {
        res.json({ success: true, message: 'Not a delivery order' });
    }
});

module.exports = deliveryRouter;
```
