### **Fallacy 4: "Visual = Easier to Debug"** ‚ùå

**Claim**: "Visual workflows are easier to understand and debug than code."

**Reality Check**:

- **True FOR** 5-node workflows (easy to see at a glance)
- **False FOR** 50-node workflows (spaghetti nightmare)
- **True FOR** non-engineers (they can't read code anyway)
- **False FOR** engineers (code is MORE readable with proper structure)

**Example**:

- **5-node workflow**: Visual is clearer (see entire flow on one screen)
- **50-node workflow**: Code with proper functions/modules is clearer (visual becomes tangled web)

**Fix**: N8N is easier for **simple workflows**, harder for **complex systems**.
