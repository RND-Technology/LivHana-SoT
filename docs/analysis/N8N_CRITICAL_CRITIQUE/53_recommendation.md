## üéØ RECOMMENDATION

**For Liv Hana in Week 1 of Pilot Training Launch:**

**ADD N8N (Option A)** with strict governance.

**Why**:

- Pilot Training = 5+ workflows (onboarding, feedback, reminders, cashback payouts, analytics)
- Marketing/ops team can build workflows (frees up Jesse for core product)
- Rapid iteration (test different incentive structures, email timing)
- Self-hosted = $100/month cost (acceptable for value gained)

**Conditions**:

- Jesse approves 10 hours/month maintenance budget
- Team commits to governance rules (simple workflows, version control, monitoring)
- We review ROI monthly (kill if not valuable)

**Next Steps (If GO)**:

1. **Today**: Deploy N8N to GCP Cloud Run (8 hours, Cheetah builds)
2. **Tomorrow**: Build first workflow (Pilot Training onboarding, 10 hours)
3. **Week 2**: Launch to 100 members, monitor for issues
4. **Month 1**: Build 4 more workflows (feedback, HNC, merchant, analytics)
5. **Month 3**: Review ROI, decide keep vs. migrate to code

**Status**: Fallacy-scanned, cost-benefit analyzed, ready for decision
**Next**: Jesse decides Option A/B/C

üêÜ **VERDICT: CONDITIONAL YES. N8N IS WORTHY FOR PILOT TRAINING + OPS AUTOMATION, BUT NOT FOR CORE PRODUCT LOGIC. SELF-HOST ON GCP, FOLLOW GOVERNANCE RULES, REVIEW ROI MONTHLY.**

**What's your call, Jesse? Option A (ADD N8N) / B (PILOT WITH ZAPIER) / C (CODE EVERYTHING)?**
