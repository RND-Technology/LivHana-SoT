### **Use Case 3: HNC Episode Publishing** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Workflow**:

```
New episode uploaded to Google Drive →
Parse metadata (title, description, tags) →
Upload to YouTube →
Post to Instagram/Facebook/Twitter →
Send email to subscriber list →
Log analytics
```

**Why N8N Wins**:

- Multiple platform integrations (YouTube, social, email)
- Non-engineers can publish (Jesse focuses on content, team handles distribution)
- Schedule posts (publish at optimal times)

**Alternative (Code)**:

- Would take 8-10 hours to code (YouTube API, social APIs, email service)
- Hard to modify schedules/platforms

**Verdict**: N8N saves 70% time here. **USE IT.**
