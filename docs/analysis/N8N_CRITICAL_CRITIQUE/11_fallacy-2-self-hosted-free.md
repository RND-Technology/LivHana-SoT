### **Fallacy 2: "Self-Hosted = Free"** ❌

**Claim**: "N8N is open source and self-hosted, so it costs nothing."

**Reality Check**:

- **Infrastructure cost**: GCP Cloud Run ($50-200/month depending on usage)
- **Maintenance cost**: Updates, security patches, debugging (5-10 hours/month)
- **Opportunity cost**: Time spent on N8N = time NOT spent on product
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to learn N8N (onboarding time)

**Total Cost**:

```
Infrastructure: $100/month
Maintenance: 10 hours/month × $150/hour = $1,500/month
Total: $1,600/month

vs. Coding workflows directly:
Engineer time: 20 hours/month × $150/hour = $3,000/month
BUT: More maintainable, no vendor dependency, team already knows how
```

**Fix**: N8N is NOT free. Compare total cost (infra + maintenance + opportunity) vs. coding directly.
