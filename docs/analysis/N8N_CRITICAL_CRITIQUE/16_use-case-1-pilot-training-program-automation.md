### **Use Case 1: Pilot Training Program Automation** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Workflow**:

```
New member application →
Check eligibility (21+, TX resident) →
If APPROVED: Send welcome email + Zoom invite + LSS download link →
Add to Airtable/Notion →
Schedule follow-up (7 days)
```

**Why N8N Wins**:

- Simple logic (if/then, no complex algorithms)
- Multiple integrations (email, calendar, database)
- Non-engineers can modify (marketing team adjusts email copy)
- Rapid iteration (test different onboarding flows)

**Alternative (Code)**:

- Would take 4-6 hours to code
- Harder for non-engineers to modify
- Less flexible for A/B testing

**Verdict**: N8N saves 60% time here. **USE IT.**
