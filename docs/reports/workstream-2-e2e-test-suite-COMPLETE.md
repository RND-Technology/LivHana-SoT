## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow Created
- File: `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`
- Triggers: Push to main/develop, pull requests
- Stages:
  1. Smoke tests (quick validation)
  2. Critical business flows
  3. API tests
  4. UI tests
  5. Error handling tests
  6. Performance tests
- Artifacts: HTML reports, failure screenshots
- PR comments with test results
- 45-minute timeout for full suite

### Test Execution Strategy
- Sequential execution for stability
- Parallel execution in CI (2 workers)
- Browser matrix: Chromium (local), +Firefox/Webkit (CI)
- Retry on first failure (CI only)
- Screenshot on failure
- Video on retention

3. BigQuery tests run in mock mode without credentials
4. Raffle system tests pending backend implementation

### Future Enhancements
1. Visual regression testing with Percy/Chromatic
2. Accessibility testing with axe-core
3. Security testing (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)
4. Load testing with k6 or Artillery
5. Database seeding for consistent test data
6. Test data cleanup automation
