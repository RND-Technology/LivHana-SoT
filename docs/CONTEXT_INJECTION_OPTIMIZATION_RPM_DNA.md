# CONTEXT INJECTION OPTIMIZATION - RPM DNA DECISION FRAMEWORK

**Created**: 2025-10-29 22:07
**Purpose**: Engineer optimal context for AI agents aligned with Jesse's RPM methodology
**Status**: Production-Ready Framework

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines the **Context Injection Engineering** system that optimizes AI agent decision-making by aligning with Jesse's RPM DNA methodology, incorporating 2025 expert best practices, and enabling weekly learning optimization.

**Core Principle**: Context is the DNA of decision-making. Inject the right context → Get the right decisions.

---

## THE RPM DNA CONTEXT FRAMEWORK

### Foundation: Tony Robbins RPM Methodology

```
RPM = Results + Purpose + Massive Action
```

**Applied to AI Context Injection**:
- **RESULTS**: What outcome does this context enable?
- **PURPOSE**: Why does this context matter to Jesse/LivHana?
- **MASSIVE ACTION**: What specific actions does this context unlock?

### The Visioneering Cascade (Jesse's Proprietary Method)

```
RPM (PRIMARY) → AOM (8 CATEGORIES) → COI (IMPROVEMENT) →
RPM (SECONDARY REFINED) → HIGH FIVE VALIDATION
```

**With Wheel of Life Progression**:
```
0 (Baseline) → NOW (Current) → NEXT (Target) → 10 (Vision)
```

## FRACTAL CONTEXT INJECTION PATTERN

### Level 1: DNA SEED (Atomic Context Unit)

Every piece of context injected must answer:

```yaml
WHAT: [Specific information being provided]
WHY: [Business value - how this serves Jesse's mission]
WHO: [Owner/stakeholder - who cares about this]
WHEN: [Temporal context - when does this matter]
WHERE: [Location/scope - where does this apply]
HOW: [Method/approach - how to use this context]
NEXT: [What this enables - future actions unlocked]
```

**Example - Good Context Injection**:
```
WHAT: START.sh reduced from 783 → 27 lines via modular boot
WHY: Aligns with Jesse's "Principle of One" - single responsibility
WHO: Jesse (CEO/R&D) + 5 agents (execution team)
WHEN: Completed 2025-10-29, active in production
WHERE: /LivHana-SoT/START.sh + scripts/boot/lib/*.sh
HOW: Sourced modules, strict mode, error handling
NEXT: Enables KILL_LIST Phase 2 (file reduction), systemd migration
```

**Example - Poor Context Injection**:
```
"The boot script was refactored and is now modular."
```
❌ Missing: WHY it matters, WHO it serves, WHAT it enables

### Level 2: CHUNK (Grouped Context)

Multiple DNA SEEDs combine into tactical context groups:

```yaml
CONTEXT_CHUNK:
  Identity: [What this group represents]
  Scope: [Boundaries of this context]
  Dependencies: [What context must come first]
  Enables: [What context this unlocks]
  Success_Criteria: [How to validate context quality]
```

### Level 3: TREE (Strategic Context)

Weekly context organization aligned with RPM planning:

```yaml
CONTEXT_TREE:
  Epic: [High-level context theme]
  Mission: [How this serves LivHana SoT]
  Timeline: [Week of context relevance]
  Cross_Agent_Coordination: [Which agents need this context]
  Weekly_Review: [Learnings to refine context]
```

## THE 8 AOM CATEGORIES - CONTEXT DECISION MATRIX

Every context injection decision must consider Jesse's 8 Areas of Mastery:

### 1. LEADERSHIP (Strategic Direction)
**Context Filter**: Does this context align with Jesse's vision?
- ✅ Include: Strategic decisions, mission alignment, R&D direction
- ❌ Exclude: Tactical details that don't affect strategy

### 2. OPERATIONS (Execution Excellence)
**Context Filter**: Does this context improve operational efficiency?
- ✅ Include: Process improvements, automation wins, system stability
- ❌ Exclude: One-off fixes that don't scale

### 3. MARKETING (Market Position)
**Context Filter**: Does this context affect market presence?
- ✅ Include: SEO wins, brand positioning, customer acquisition
- ❌ Exclude: Internal tooling unrelated to market

### 4. SALES (Revenue Generation)
**Context Filter**: Does this context drive revenue?
- ✅ Include: Conversion improvements, funnel optimization, deal flow
- ❌ Exclude: Backend infrastructure with no revenue impact

### 5. FINANCE (Resource Optimization)
**Context Filter**: Does this context affect costs or ROI?
- ✅ Include: Cost savings, efficiency gains, resource allocation
- ❌ Exclude: Neutral changes with no financial impact

### 6. TECHNOLOGY (Innovation & Scale)
**Context Filter**: Does this context advance technical capability?
- ✅ Include: Architecture improvements, scalability wins, tech debt reduction
- ❌ Exclude: Cosmetic changes with no technical merit

### 7. CULTURE (Team & Values)
**Context Filter**: Does this context reinforce Jesse's values?
- ✅ Include: "One Shot One Kill", "Sheriff Accountability", "Zero Placeholders"
- ❌ Exclude: Shortcuts that violate principles

### 8. SOP (Systems & Processes)
**Context Filter**: Does this context improve repeatability?
- ✅ Include: Documented processes, automation scripts, templates
- ❌ Exclude: Ad-hoc solutions that can't be replicated

## HIGH FIVE VALIDATION - CONTEXT QUALITY CHECK

Before injecting context, validate with 5 fingers:

### ✋ FINGER 1: RPM ALIGNMENT
- [ ] Does this context serve a clear RESULT?
- [ ] Is the PURPOSE (why it matters) explicit?
- [ ] Does it enable MASSIVE ACTION?

### ✋ FINGER 2: AOM MASTERY
- [ ] Which of the 8 AOM categories does this serve?
- [ ] Is the mastery level clear (0-10 scale)?
- [ ] Does it move from NOW → NEXT?

### ✋ FINGER 3: COI IMPROVEMENT
- [ ] What specific improvement does this enable?
- [ ] Is it measurable on the Wheel of Life?
- [ ] Does it address a known pain point?

### ✋ FINGER 4: EXECUTION FEASIBILITY
- [ ] Can agents act on this context immediately?
- [ ] Are dependencies clearly stated?
- [ ] Is the "NEXT" action obvious?

### ✋ FINGER 5: MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS
- [ ] How will we know this context was valuable?
- [ ] What metrics validate its impact?
- [ ] Can we learn from this for next week?

**If all 5 fingers pass → Inject the context**
**If any finger fails → Refine before injection**

## EXPERT BEST PRACTICES (2025 FRONTIER)

### 1. Semantic Chunking (Not Token Chunking)

**Anti-Pattern**: "Here's 10,000 tokens of context"
**Best Practice**: "Here's 3 semantic chunks: Architecture, Current State, Next Actions"

**Why**: AI models process meaning, not tokens. Semantic boundaries improve comprehension.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

**Anti-Pattern**: Dump all context upfront
**Best Practice**: Layer context as needed (DNA → CHUNK → TREE → FOREST)

**Why**: Cognitive load management. Start atomic, zoom out as needed.

### 3. Context Versioning

**Anti-Pattern**: Overwrite context without history
**Best Practice**: Version context like code (rpm/seeds/2025-10-29/, rpm/archive/2025-Q3/)

**Why**: Learning requires history. Track what context worked when.

### 4. Multi-Agent Context Coordination

**Anti-Pattern**: Each agent gets different context
**Best Practice**: Shared context tree, agent-specific views

**Why**: Consistency across agents. Planning agent orchestrates, execution agents consume.

### 5. Context Compression via Principles

**Anti-Pattern**: Repeat detailed instructions every time
**Best Practice**: Encode principles once, reference by name

**Example**:
```yaml
Principles:
  - "One Shot One Kill": Execute completely, no placeholders
  - "Sheriff Accountability": Own outcomes, delegate responsibility
  - "Principle of One": Single responsibility per module

Context_Injection:
  "Apply 'One Shot One Kill' to this refactoring"
  # vs 500 words explaining what that means
```

### 6. Feedback Loops (The Learning Engine)

**Anti-Pattern**: Static context that never improves
**Best Practice**: Weekly context optimization based on outcomes

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Capture what worked
./scripts/rpm/weekly_review.sh capture_wins

# Analyze patterns
./scripts/rpm/weekly_review.sh analyze_patterns

# Update templates
./scripts/rpm/weekly_review.sh optimize_templates
```

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Context Dumping
**Problem**: "Here's everything I know about the system"
**Solution**: Filter through AOM categories, inject only what serves current RESULT

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Ambiguous Context
**Problem**: "The system needs improvement"
**Solution**: "Operations AOM at 6/10, target 8/10 via boot refactoring (2h 40min)"

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Stale Context
**Problem**: Using last month's context for this week's decisions
**Solution**: Weekly context refresh, archive old context, version new context

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Missing "Why"
**Problem**: "Do this task" (no PURPOSE)
**Solution**: "Do this task BECAUSE it unblocks X and serves Y mission"

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 5: No Validation Loop
**Problem**: Inject context, never check if it helped
**Solution**: Weekly review - what context led to best outcomes?

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 6: One-Size-Fits-All
**Problem**: Same context for planning agent and execution agent
**Solution**: Shared TREE, agent-specific CHUNKS (planning needs strategy, execution needs tactics)
