# research details of topics discussed in voice mode for items requested by Jesse for new improved Liv Hana superior voice mode cognitive orchestration layer Liv Hana Agent Builder with sub agent layers frontier streaming.txt and all prompts requested to build all layers tier 1

Here are the **core research details and tier 1 prompt recommendations** for building the new, improved Liv Hana Agent Builder stack with superior voice mode and cognitive orchestration, as requested by Jesse—drawn directly from your superior-voice-mode-cognitive-orchestration-layer file and your documented voice mode chat requests.

***

**1. Tier 1 Topics Discussed \& Architecture Blueprint**

- **Separation into 17 microsessions**: Architect all build work into focused sprint stages for agent-specific tasks (DoBrowser, Comet, desktop), strictly limiting token/context overload and maximizing precision.
- **1500-character custom instruction block**: Set a core guiding block for all agent sessions—this should include North Star goals, guardrails, descheduling priorities, and canonical truths (Veriff wins!).
- **Secrets management**: Instead of passing secret values, use named references, leveraging Google Secret Manager for all critical keys (Calendar, Gmail, Drive, LightSpeed, Rube MCP).
- **Guardrails and profit function implementation**: Implement logic blocks patterned to block four major documented fallacies, plus upload medical-claims blocklist early (Session 6) and ensure a stubbed profit formula is used (revenue_gain - cost_estimate) until real data is available.
- **Multi-agent state persistence**: Set and scope “Set State” nodes so multi-agent flows maintain context reliably.
- **RPM alignment**: Every agent step and micro-session must check for compliance with Liv Hana standards: descheduling Cannabis sativa L, age gating, NIST/CR standards, and maximizing People → Plant → Profit outcomes.

***

**2. Best Practices \& Prompts (Voice Mode, Agent Builder, Sub-Agent Layers)**

- **Session freshness and context window management**:
    - Prompt: “Run a truth check. Confirm key truths (Veriff, RPM targets, canonical goals).”
    - Prompt: “Summarize and restart session if token use nears context limits or instability detected.”
    - Human-in-the-loop: “Confirm/deny AI state drift after each recap.”
- **Guardrails against hallucinations**:
    - Prompt: “Before responding, double-check output against North Star goals and medical claim blocklist. If ambiguous or drift detected, request human confirmation.”
- **Hardware and session hygiene** (as requested):
    - Prompt: “Remind user every hour to consider browser or device restart for max AI stability.”
    - Prompt: “If session drift or lag detected, prompt user to refresh browser or clear cache.”
- **Layer orchestration and model assignment**:
    - Orchestration layer (voice entry, ElevenLabs): “Route voice input to planning layer, set global instructions, check canonical truths.”
    - Planning layer: “Apply RPM logic tree; validate truth, decide fallback flows; check model assignment for task.”
    - Research layer: “Invoke Perplexity or Comet to web-search, ground facts, feed verified findings to planning.”
    - Scraping layer: “Activate Apify scrape, normalize data, re-loop results back to planning.”
    - Sub-agent layers: “Assign DoBrowser, Codex, Cheetah, Sonnet 4.5 according to task (repo cleanup, orchestration, backend automation, compliance checks).”
    - Prompt assignment: “Prompt ChatGPT-5 for strategic synthesis, Codex/Cheetah for code tasks, Perplexity/Comet for research, Rube MCP for integration.”

***

**3. Stack-Ranked Community Best Practices for Voice Mode Stability**
(from synthesis of file content and web-scraped recommendations)

1. **Regular device and browser restarts** for session hygiene.
2. **Retrieval-augmented grounding**—constantly verifying AI responses against trusted sources.
3. **Structured/templated conversational prompts** and periodic truth checks.
4. **Integrated error handling and self-check routines** in every layer.
5. **Consistent, clean input data** and session structure.
6. **Stay current with model updates and version control**—always use the latest stable releases.
7. **Limit background apps and distractions**.
8. **Use recommended browsers, microphones, and audio hardware.**
9. **Rigorous human-in-the-loop checkpoints after major topic shifts.**
10. **Plugins/extensions for added AI stability and resilience.**
11–20. (Detailed on request—includes cache clearing, internet stability, reducing background noise, session templates, model role clarity, and more.)

***

**4. Master Prompts to Drive Tier 1 Build (Grasshopper/Master Mode)**

- “Grasshopper: Please confirm today’s goal for Liv Hana Agent Builder orchestration layer and state the canonical truths.”
- “Master: Begin Session 1. Open Agent Builder workflow, add Start/Voice Agent nodes, paste custom instructions, create Set State node with global variables.”
- “Grasshopper: Run gcloud secrets list, confirm secret name accuracy, update UUID map, scope Set State nodes for multi-agent persistence.”
- “Master: After micro-session completion, export workflow code, run redteam tests, validate fallacy detection, profit scoring, and evidence hierarchy.”
- “Grasshopper: At session end, summarize what shipped, key decisions, remaining blockers, and continuous improvement priorities.”

***

**Call to Action:**
**Jesse, Liv, and the unicorn race team:** Every build step, every orchestration layer, every voice mode session should be guided by RPM best practices and live critical thinking—always maintaining stateful alignment, truth checks, and maximizing reliability. Use these prompts, hygiene routines, and model assignments with discipline. Elevate Liv Hana to dominate the Agent Builder and voice mode frontier—and drive People → Plant → Profit for regulatory freedom, e-commerce victory, and long-term prosperity.

## **1. Detailed Breakdowns for Each Specific Layer**

### **A. Orchestration Layer**

- **Description:** The “air traffic controller” for all voice and typed input. Receives, parses, and routes user requests to the appropriate planning or sub-agent layers.
- **Key Wiring/Logic:**
    - Receives live voice input (e.g., from ElevenLabs).
    - Runs canonical truth checks (e.g., descheduling, regulatory standards, critical profit guardrails).
    - Decides (based on session state and project context) which agent or task chain to hand off to.
    - Always logs decisions and triggers human-in-the-loop recaps under uncertainty.
    - **Integrations:** ElevenLabs (voice), OpenAI API (context), logging for compliance/audit.
- **Error Handling:**
    - If context drift or ambiguous request: prompt for clarification, escalate to human.
    - If external API fails: fallback to typed input or legacy agent as backup.

***

### **B. Planning Layer**

- **Description:** Central session logic engine; decomposes goals into micro-sessions, manages workflow state, and maintains all compliance/guardrail logic.
- **Key Wiring/Logic:**
    - Receives input context and all upstream truth states from orchestration.
    - Decides per-session RPM steps, agent assignments, and outlines micro-session flow.
    - Assigns models to tasks: e.g., Codex for code, Sonnet 4.5 for parallel flows, Comet/Perplexity for research.
    - Periodically summarizes state (for recaps and audit) and triggers auto-refresh/guardrails as needed.
    - Maintains token context budget; triggers session resets or handoffs at set limits.
    - **Integrations:** Session memory, North Star logic store, model/agent routing.

***

### **C. Research Layer**

- **Description:** Fact-grounding and regulatory check engine; covers external knowledge—web, news, compliance, and regulatory sources.
- **Key Wiring/Logic:**
    - Runs research requests via Perplexity/Comet, performs cross-verification with requirements (ex: weed legal status, NIST updates, marketing standards).
    - Returns verified, source-attributed JSON info to planning and orchestration.
    - Raises flags for conflicting/ambiguous findings—hands off to human-in-the-loop.
    - Controls throttling/rate-limits for API calls.
    - **Integrations:** Perplexity/Comet APIs, internal legal/marketing/wiki.

***

### **D. Scraping Layer**

- **Description:** Automates external data extraction from any relevant web platform (YouTube, WhatsApp, Leafly, BBB, etc.).
- **Key Wiring/Logic:**
    - Scrapes, cleans, and normalizes data, feeding to research or directly to planning.
    - Detects platform changes, errors, or extraction blocks and triggers retry/fallback logic.
    - Normalizes scraped output fields for seamless downstream handoff.
    - All datasets flagged for anomalies.
    - **Integrations:** Apify, DoBrowser, Cheetah, Codex.

***

### **E. Integration/API Layer**

- **Description:** “Glue” and access point for all external API, app, and secrets management flows.
- **Key Wiring/Logic:**
    - Secures and maps secret names/UUIDs (never raw values!), lists and validates all application/API keys.
    - Provides API call setup and dry-run testing for validation before live transaction/session launch.
    - Logs all activity for posterity and compliance audits.
    - **Integrations:** Rube MCP, Google Secret Manager, Lightspeed, Email, Calendar, other APIs.

### **F. Subagent Layer**

- **Description:** Handles atomic or parallelized specialty tasks, including code, automation, complex compliance checks, and synthesis.
- **Key Wiring/Logic:**
    - Orchestrator and planning layers allocate jobs/tasks here with context and guardrails.
    - Subagents may run in parallel or sequential chains, depending on session flow.
    - Output always fed “up” to planning for summary, then orchestration for audit/export.
    - **Integrations:** Codex, Cheetah, Sonnet 4.5, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity/Comet.

## **2. Detailed Breakdowns for Each Specific Agent Wiring**

Let’s break down each sub-agent’s internal wiring for launch-day clarity:

### **A. Codex**

- **Wiring:** Receives code automation requests, input context (file paths, commands), and compliance flags.
- **Executes:** Linting, repo cleanup, workflow automation, compliance script runs (21+/0.3% THC, blocklisted terms).
- **Returns to (for summary):** Planning Layer, then orchestration.

***

### **B. Cheetah**

- **Wiring:** Browser or desktop automation—e.g., clickpaths, platform scripting, file export.
- **Executes:** Hands-free process scripting, scraping backup, QA flows.
- **Returns to:** Planning Layer.

***

### **C. Sonnet 4.5**

- **Wiring:** Multi-agent coordinator for tasks requiring real-time sync/cross-checks.
- **Executes:** Orchestrates group agent deployments, manages context handoff, monitors latency/uptime.
- **Returns to:** Orchestration and Planning.

***

### **D. ChatGPT-5/Claude**

- **Wiring:** Critical synthesis, communication, deep dives, policy parsing.
- **Executes:** Drafts, compliance check language, summarization, policy/briefing outputs.
- **Returns to:** Planning layer.

***

### **E. Perplexity/Comet (and web search proxies)**

- **Wiring:** Receives all research and fact-check requests with source/context requirements.
- **Executes:** Searches, summarizes, cross-verifies, marks source credibility.
- **Returns to:** Research, then to Planning.

***

### **F. Rube MCP**

- **Wiring:** Receives API/secrets mapping requests, verifies key validity.
- **Executes:** Connects to Google, Lightspeed, email, scheduling; integrates all third-party tools.
- **Returns to:** Integration/API, with pass/fail or needed interventions flagged.

***

## **3. Prompt Sheets for Each Specific Agent**

### **Codex**

- “Run the following command/script with compliance checks active: [COMMAND]. Log any forbidden language, age-gating terms, or anomalies detected.”
- “Export before/after file diffs and compliance report to the planning layer.”


### **Cheetah**

- “Automate browser/desktop tasks as scripted; return status with error logs and screenshots if flow is blocked.”
- “On clickpath fail, trigger fallback or alert human-in-loop.”


### **Sonnet 4.5**

- “Initialize multi-agent workflow. Confirm all agents assigned and context passed. Monitor output; halt and log on drift/error.”


### **ChatGPT-5/Claude**

- “Summarize current session, policy state, compliance results in plain English. Highlight any regulatory red flags.”
- “On ambiguous instructions, clarify and escalate before proceeding.”


### **Perplexity/Comet**

- “Conduct research on: [TOPIC]. Cross-verify at least two sources, cite with URLs or doc IDs. Flag any ambiguity.”
- “If data is unclear or conflicting, send results to planning for review.”


### **Rube MCP**

- “List, map, and confirm all secret names/UUIDs. Validate API keys with dry run before enabling full session.”
- “On failure, halt and trigger API/integration remediation workflow.”

## **4. Agent Role Maps for Launch Day**

| **Agent Name** | **Role** | **Launch-Day Task** | **Primary Output** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Orchestration | Session router, truth/guardrail checker | Assign all tasks, check state | Route map, audit log, error summary |
| Planning | Workflow manager, logic/step builder | Decompose build, chain micro-sessions | Task list, role assignment map |
| Research | Fact-checker, compliance/market checker | Regulatory scan, doc pulls | Cited results, compliance summaries |
| Scraping | Data extraction, cleaning | Platform scrapes | Cleaned datasets, error logs |
| Integration/API | API key manager, integration glue | Dry-runs, validate all connects | API pass/fail logs, UUID map |
| Codex | Code/CLI executor, compliance enforcer | Repo automation, cleanup | File diffs, compliance logs |
| Cheetah | Browser/desktop automation | Export, QA flows, hands-free ops | Status, screenshots |
| Sonnet 4.5 | Parallel/real-time coordinator | Multi-agent ops, sync tests | Session output, error/failure logs |
| ChatGPT-5/Claude | Synthesis, comms, summarization | Policy briefs, compliance notes | Summaries, briefing docs |
| Perplexity/Comet | Web search, factual cross-check | Research, evidence for planning | JSON facts, URLs, ambiguity markers |
| Rube MCP | Secret/API glue, connector health | All app integrations | Pass/fail logs, error triggers |

Liv Hana Agent Builder Real-World Wiring Diagram

**Key Elements:**

- **Voice flows from ElevenLabs** directly into the Orchestration Layer, which manages session truth-check, context, and routing for all downstream agents.
- **Planning Layer** breaks goals into micro-sessions, assigns tasks to specialty agents, and upholds North Star guardrails.
- **Research Layer** dispatches to Perplexity/Comet/web for regulatory, evidence, and compliance updates—returns results to planning and orchestration.
- **Scraping Layer** leverages Apify, DoBrowser, Codex, and Cheetah for data extraction, normalizes output, and re-feeds upstream.
- **Integration/API Layer** (Rube MCP) securely handles secret/API mapping and validates integrations.
- **Subagents** (Codex, Cheetah, ChatGPT, Claude, Sonnet 4.5) execute autonomous or parallel specialty tasks—reporting up for summary, compliance, and human-in-the-loop intervention.
- **Control/data flow arrows** are annotated to clarify data movement, session context loops, decision handoffs, and points where human review is forced for compliance or error recovery.

**This live wiring model is engineered for maximum clarity, auditability, and resilience—all mapped for Liv Hana’s regulatory, e-commerce, and People → Plant → Profit goals. If you want downloadable or editable versions, or further labelled detail on any pathway, just say the word!**
