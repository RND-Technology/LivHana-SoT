# MCP Broker Fallacy Corrections - 2025-10-17

**Context**: Initial MCP broker validation attempt revealed incorrect assumptions about architecture and token format.
**Result**: Corrected understanding documented, proper configuration guide created.

## üö® FALLACIES IDENTIFIED & CORRECTED

### Fallacy 1: Token Prefix Format

**INCORRECT ASSUMPTION**:
- Token should start with `op_` (1Password item reference style)
- Warning triggered when token started with `ops_`

**CORRECT REALITY**:
- Token format: `ops_*` (OpenAI Platform Service authentication token)
- Example: `ops_eyJzaW...` ‚úÖ CORRECT FORMAT
- `op_*` would be a 1Password CLI reference, not the actual token

**Root Cause**: Confused 1Password reference syntax (`op://vault/item/field`) with actual OpenAI service token prefix.

**Naming Confusion to Avoid**:
- `ops_*` = OpenAI Platform Service token prefix
- `op://` = 1Password CLI reference syntax
- OPS Layer = One Plant Solution (advocacy business layer in R&D/HNC/OPS/HERB model)

### Fallacy 2: Direct MCP Broker HTTP Testing

**INCORRECT ASSUMPTION**:
- MCP broker should have standard REST endpoints (`/health`, `/tools`, etc.)
- Should be testable via direct curl commands from local machine
- HTTP 404 means broker is misconfigured

**CORRECT REALITY**:
- MCP broker is NOT a standalone REST API
- Designed to be called BY OpenAI Agent Builder, not by us directly
- Uses MCP protocol (JSON-RPC-like), not standard REST
- `/health` endpoint doesn't exist (or isn't publicly exposed)
- HTTP 404 is expected when trying to curl endpoints directly

**Architecture Correction**:
```
WRONG:
Your M4 Max ‚Üí [curl] ‚Üí MCP Broker ‚Üí LivHana-SoT

CORRECT:
Your M4 Max ‚Üí [chat] ‚Üí OpenAI Agent Builder ‚Üí [MCP protocol] ‚Üí MCP Broker ‚Üí LivHana-SoT
```

**Root Cause**: Assumed MCP broker was a general-purpose API with standard REST conventions. It's actually a specialized service mesh for OpenAI's MCP protocol.

### Fallacy 3: Testing Strategy

**INCORRECT APPROACH**:
- Create shell scripts to curl the MCP broker directly
- Validate health endpoints
- Test authentication with bearer token via curl

**CORRECT APPROACH**:
- Configure MCP broker URL + token IN OpenAI Agent Builder
- Send test queries through Agent Builder chat interface
- Monitor Agent Builder tool invocations
- Check GCP Cloud Run logs for broker activity
- Validate through LivHana-SoT repository changes

**Root Cause**: Treated MCP broker as a microservice to be tested independently, rather than as an integration layer accessed through OpenAI.

### Fallacy 4: Endpoint Structure

**INCORRECT ASSUMPTION**:
- Primary endpoint: `/health`
- Tool listing: `/tools`
- General structure: Standard REST API paths

**CORRECT REALITY**:
- Primary endpoint: `/mcp/invoke`
- Tool listing: Via MCP protocol `{"method": "tools/list"}` payload
- Structure: MCP-specific JSON-RPC-like protocol

**Evidence**: HTTP 404 when accessing `/health` confirms non-standard endpoint structure.

## ‚úÖ CORRECTED CONFIGURATION

### Token Configuration ‚úÖ

**Format**: `ops_eyJzaW...` (OpenAI Platform Service)
**Storage**: 1Password vault ‚úÖ
**Usage**: Configured IN OpenAI Agent Builder, not used for direct curl

### MCP Broker URL ‚úÖ

**URL**: `https://mcp-broker-prod-9809f04432sl.us-central1.run.app`
**Endpoint**: `/mcp/invoke` (configured in Agent Builder)
**Protocol**: MCP (Model Context Protocol), not REST

### Validation Approach ‚úÖ

**Method**: Test through OpenAI Agent Builder
**Steps**:
1. Configure MCP server in Agent Builder
2. Add URL: `https://mcp-broker-prod-9809f04432sl.us-central1.run.app/mcp/invoke`
3. Add bearer token: `ops_*` from 1Password
4. Send test query: "List available MCP tools"
5. Monitor tool invocations in Agent Builder UI
6. Check GCP Cloud Run logs for broker activity

## üìä Impact Assessment

### What Worked Despite Fallacies ‚úÖ

1. **Repository validation**: Confirmed LivHana-SoT structure is correct
2. **Token retrieval**: Successfully retrieved token from 1Password
3. **Architecture understanding**: Core flow (Agent Builder ‚Üí Broker ‚Üí SoT) was correct
4. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive guides (even if some assumptions were wrong)

### What Failed Due to Fallacies ‚ùå

1. **Direct health check**: HTTP 404 (expected, endpoint doesn't exist)
2. **Tool listing via curl**: N/A (wrong approach)
3. **Shell script validation**: Can't test MCP broker directly from local machine

### What Was Corrected ‚úÖ

1. **Token prefix validation**: Now accepts `ops_*` as correct format
2. **Testing strategy**: Documented correct approach (via Agent Builder)
3. **Endpoint understanding**: Clarified `/mcp/invoke` is the actual endpoint
4. **Architecture diagram**: Updated to show OpenAI as intermediary

## üéì Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Don't Assume Standard Patterns

**Mistake**: Assumed MCP broker follows REST API conventions
**Reality**: MCP is a specialized protocol, not REST
**Takeaway**: Always verify protocol specifications before testing

### Lesson 2: Verify Token Formats

**Mistake**: Assumed `op_` prefix based on 1Password reference syntax
**Reality**: OpenAI uses `ops_` prefix for Platform Service tokens
**Takeaway**: Token prefix conventions vary by service, always check docs

### Lesson 3: Understand Architecture Layers

**Mistake**: Tried to bypass OpenAI and call MCP broker directly
**Reality**: MCP broker is designed to be called BY OpenAI, not by end users
**Takeaway**: Respect architecture boundaries, test at correct layer

### Lesson 4: Naming Can Be Confusing

**Mistake**: Confused "ops" token prefix with "OPS" business layer
**Reality**: Three different meanings:
  - `ops_*` = OpenAI Platform Service token
  - `op://` = 1Password CLI reference
  - OPS = One Plant Solution layer
**Takeaway**: Maintain clear distinction between similar-sounding terms

**Status**: ‚úÖ All fallacies corrected, documentation updated, ready for proper configuration
**Blocking Action**: Configure MCP broker in OpenAI Agent Builder
**Owner**: Jesse Niesen (CEO)
**Created**: 2025-10-17

**Bottom Line**: We initially tried to test the MCP broker like a REST API. It's not. It's an MCP protocol service meant to be called by OpenAI Agent Builder. Configure it there, test through Agent Builder chat, monitor in GCP logs. Your `ops_*` token is correct.
