# SESSION PROGRESS

Last updated: 2025-10-21 (local)

## Current Status

- Claude-tier1 restored for Cursor shells via `~/.local/bin/claude-tier1` launcher.
- Claude Code CLI installed/available; will fall back to `claude-code chat` if `claude` isn’t present.
- SoT boot script verified at `LivHana-SoT/boot`.

## Recovery Artifacts

- Emergency snapshot created: `/Users/jesseniesen/LivHana-Trinity-Local/6.tmp/emergency_snapshot_20251020_210130.tar.gz` (includes `LivHana-SoT` and `.cursor` meta).

## How to Launch

Run from anywhere:

```bash
claude-tier1
```

This will:

- cd to `~/LivHana-Trinity-Local/LivHana-SoT`
- prompt `op signin` if needed (1Password CLI)
- source `./boot`
- start the available Claude CLI

## Notes / Next Steps

- SoT has uncommitted changes; validate, then commit with Tier‑1 checks (lint/tests/Playwright MCP) before push.
- If `claude-tier1` isn’t found, ensure `~/.local/bin` is on PATH and re-open the terminal.
