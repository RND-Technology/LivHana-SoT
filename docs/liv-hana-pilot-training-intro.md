## **PRE-TRAINING THOUGHT PROVOKERS 🤔**

### **Strategic Thinking Questions**

*Spend 15-20 minutes reflecting on each question. Write down your honest thoughts - no right or wrong answers, just authentic reflection that will help you engage meaningfully tomorrow.*

**1. Vision & Mission Alignment**
What draws you most powerfully to the mission of descheduling Cannabis sativa L, and how do you envision your unique talents contributing to this historic transformation? Consider both the personal and professional motivations that brought you to this opportunity.

**2. Multi-Layer Business Complexity**
When you imagine simultaneously managing R&D compliance operations, HNC creative content production, OPS legislative advocacy, and HERB e-commerce optimization, what aspects excite you most and what elements concern you? How do you typically handle complex, multi-faceted challenges?

**3. AI-Human Partnership Philosophy**
How comfortable are you with AI-assisted decision making in high-stakes business environments? What do you hope to learn about optimizing human-AI collaboration, and what reservations or questions do you have about working closely with Liv Hana AI EA?

**4. Conservative Audience Engagement**
How would you authentically explain cannabis legalization benefits to a conservative, faith-based audience in a way that genuinely aligns with their core values of freedom, safety, family protection, and economic prosperity? What messaging approaches would you avoid?

**5. Satirical Content Balance**
What's the crucial difference between effective political satire that changes minds and content that might alienate or offend your target audience? How do you walk the line between humor and respect, especially when addressing controversial topics?

### **Personal Leadership & Development Questions**

**6. Multi-Stakeholder Leadership Experience**
Describe a specific time when you had to coordinate multiple moving pieces toward a common goal involving different personality types and competing priorities. What leadership approach worked, what failed, and what would you do differently with the wisdom you have now?

**7. Rapid Learning & Pressure Performance**
This training program moves at an intense pace with complex, interconnected information across legal, creative, political, and commercial domains. How do you best absorb, process, and apply new knowledge when under time pressure and performance expectations?

**8. Ethical Navigation in Gray Areas**
Cannabis remains federally illegal while being state-legal, creating constant ethical and legal complexity. How do you personally navigate situations where you must operate within legal gray areas while maintaining your integrity and protecting others?

**9. Adaptive Communication Mastery**
You'll need to communicate effectively with hemp farmers, entertainment creators, legislative staffers, legal professionals, customers, and AI systems - all requiring different languages, tones, and approaches. How do you adapt your communication style while remaining authentic?

**10. Innovation & Systems Thinking**
If you could design one systematic improvement to the American cannabis industry that would benefit consumers, businesses, and society simultaneously, what would it be and why? Walk through your reasoning and implementation approach.

### **Mission-Critical Scenario Questions**

**11. Crisis Management Under Pressure**
Imagine: A compliance violation temporarily shuts down R&D operations, HNC content gets flagged for policy violations, OPS faces a legislative emergency, and HERB experiences a technical failure - all within 48 hours. Walk through your step-by-step coordination response across all four layers while maintaining team morale and mission focus.

**12. Strategic Opportunity Recognition**
You discover a legislative loophole that could accelerate Texas cannabis reform by 18 months, but exploiting it requires significant resource reallocation and carries reputation risks. How do you evaluate this opportunity, build consensus among stakeholders, and manage the inherent risks while maximizing the potential impact?

**13. Long-term Vision & Measurement**
The ultimate goal is making Texas the global model for cannabis freedom, safety, and prosperity. What would total success look like in 5 years across all four business layers? How would you measure progress toward this vision, and what leading indicators would you track monthly?

**14. Relationship Optimization Strategy**
You're building working relationships with Jesse (CEO/visionary), Liv Hana AI (24/7 assistant), Andrea Steel (legal counsel), fellow pilots (peers), and various external stakeholders. How do you maximize the value and effectiveness of each relationship type while contributing to overall mission success?

**15. Personal Legacy & Impact Definition**
By the completion of this 12-week training program, what specific reputation and capabilities do you want to be known for within the Jesse Niesen cannabis empire and the broader industry? What would make you proud of your contribution to this historic mission?

### **Bonus Reflection Questions**

**16. Risk Assessment & Mitigation**
What are the top 3 professional and personal risks you see in joining this mission, and how would you proactively mitigate each one? What safeguards or support systems would help you succeed?

**17. Success Metrics Definition**
How will you personally measure whether this training program was worth your time and energy investment? What outcomes would make you enthusiastically recommend this opportunity to someone you care about?

**18. Knowledge Transfer & Teaching**
Assuming you master these systems and approaches, how would you teach these skills to someone else? What aspects would be most challenging to transfer, and how would you overcome those teaching challenges?

**19. Industry Evolution Prediction**
Where do you see the cannabis industry in 3-5 years, both in Texas specifically and nationally? How does this training position you to capitalize on those trends and contribute to positive industry evolution?

**20. Personal Growth Edge**
What aspect of this training program will most likely push you outside your comfort zone in a growth-producing way? How do you typically handle situations that challenge your existing skills and perspectives?
