# RPM WEEKLY PLAN — CURRENT (Oct 21–27, 2025)

**Compliance:** LifeWard | 21+ (GA-56) | COA/NIST | Brands-not-characters
**Version:** 4.1 (FUSED: Revenue + Tech + Team + Voice + Blockchain + Infrastructure)
**Updated:** 2025-10-23 06:45 CDT

## 🔴 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ALERT

**STATUS**: Claude Tier-1 boot system failure investigation IN PROGRESS

**IMPACT**: All 5 foundation agents (Planning, Research, Artifacts, Execution, QA) blocked from spawning. This is a SHOW-STOPPER blocking all autonomous operations and $439K-$729K strategic value delivery.

**PRIORITY**: HIGHEST - Infrastructure blocker affecting entire ecosystem

**INVESTIGATION**: Active root cause analysis underway
- Analyzing START.sh → claude_tier1_boot.sh execution flow
- Checking agent spawn logic and tmux session management
- Validating environment (Node 20, Redis, GCP auth)
- Testing coordination protocol and status file system

**EXPECTED RESOLUTION**: Within 2-3 hours (systematic investigation + fix + validation)

**DETAILED TRACKING**: See `/Users/jesseniesen/LivHana-Trinity-Local/LivHana-SoT/RPM_INFRA_CLAUDE_TIER1_BOOTFIX_20251023.md`

---

## Result

Deploy TRUTH Pipeline + Agent Builder + Compliance Service; recover $125K-175K revenue (Veriff ID verification + win-back); meet DSHS compliance (Oct 26 deadline); enable voice orchestration + music tokenization for VIP members—wired for dashboards, agent workflows, and team adoption.

## Purpose

Create a machine- and human-readable weekly plan that agents can parse fast (search/scan efficient), teams can execute with <5min voice stand-ups, and customers can engage with (music co-ownership, blockchain profit-sharing, sovereign operator status).

### **TWO-SIDED COIN INTEGRATION:**

Every RPM card now tracks **PLANNING** (Result/Purpose/MAP) + **FINANCIALS** (Revenue/Cost/Profit/ROI)  
→ Enables real-time profit optimization and predictive project timelines

## Calendar Blocks (Compact)

- Jesse: Mon–Fri 9–5 CST → TRUTH; Compliance; Community
- Andrew: Mon–Fri 8–6 CST → MCP; TRUTH scripts; Agent Builder; LightSpeed
- Christopher: Mon–Fri 9–5 CST → VIP beta; ops; maintenance
- Charlie: Mon–Fri 10–4 CST → COA QA; inventory; dashboards

## Critical Path

MCP Broker (Andrew) → TRUTH Pipeline (Jesse/Andrew) → Agent Builder (Jesse/Andrew) → VIP Cockpit (Christopher/Charlie)

## Compliance & TRUTH Checks

- GA-56 21+ gate on all customer flows; COA/NIST for novel cannabinoids.
- TRUTH 5-point verification appended to artifacts (see /out/ingestion.md).

## Dashboard Wiring (search/scan aids)

- Gantt: `charts/hnc_rpm_gantt.mmd`
- Kanban: `boards/notion_kanban.csv`
- RPM Block: `RPM_Weekly_Update_Block.md`
- Reconciliation: `out/repo_reconciliation.md` → `out/commit_suggestions.md`

## Glue Index (no cross-layer leakage)

- HNC sovereignty respected; R&D ↔ OPS only where defined; microcopy CTAs isolated.

## One Thing (per owner)

- Jesse: TRUTH + Compliance framework finalized.
- Andrew: MCP live + core TRUTH scripts shipped.
- Christopher: VIP cockpit beta live in-store.
- Charlie: COA remediation QA complete.

## Evidence Pointers

- Source: `out/ingestion.md`, `out/index.json`, `out/gantt.md`, `out/kanban.json`
- **MASTER RPM (AI-Optimized):** `RPM_MASTER_PLAN_OCT21-27_2025_AI_OPTIMIZED.md` (940 lines, machine + human)
- External RPM (v3.0): `/Users/jesseniesen/LivHana-Trinity-Local/RPM_WEEKLY_PLAN_OCT21-27_2025_COMPLETE.md` (revenue focus)
- Team Pilot (v3.1): `LivHana-SoT/RPM_WEEKLY_PLAN_OCT21-27_2025_TEAM_PILOT_v3.1.md` (training + compliance)
- Voice Transcripts: Integrated (music tokenization, two-sided coin, Slack integration)

## New Initiatives (from Voice Mode Analysis)

### **Music Tokenization + Blockchain Ownership** (Week 2-4)

- VIP member co-ownership model: Suno song creation → one-click blockchain onboarding → monthly royalty payments
- Customer journey: reggieanddro.com → Liv Hana creates personalized song → smart contract → profit-sharing
- ROI: 3x-30x LTV ($50-500 per customer vs $2-15 acquisition cost)

### **Custom GPT "Liv Hana VIP"** (ChatGPT App Store - Week 1-3)

- Parallel track to Agent Builder (proof of concept, data collection)
- Features: Cannabis intelligence + music creation + blockchain onboarding + RPM facilitation
- Timeline: Week 1 creation, Week 2 beta, Week 3 submission, Month 2 public launch

### **Slack + Voice Mode Integration** (3 options)

1. **Hybrid** (TODAY, 15 min): Webhook auto-posts results to #liv-hana-updates
2. **Events API Bridge** (Wednesday, 2-4 hours): @livhana mentions trigger Agent Builder
3. **Full Bot** (Week 2, 6-8 hours): Slash commands, voice messages, dashboard widgets

## Team Actions (IMMEDIATE)

### **TODAY 8:00am - Jesse + Andrew:**

Execute `bash scripts/add_missing_secrets.sh` (15 min) → Unblocks Agent Builder + TRUTH Pipeline

### **TODAY 9:00am - ALL:**

FIRST voice stand-up (Google Meet, 15 min) → Format: "Liv" → wins/priorities/blockers → "Normal chat"

### **TODAY 10:00am - Andrew:**

1. Deploy Compliance Service to Cloud Run (10 min)
2. Launch win-back campaign (80+ customers, 15% off code)

## TRUTH Footer

All numeric claims require verification steps recorded in `out/fallacy_risk_register.md`. Age‑gate and COA tags present across user-facing flows.

**Fallacy Corrections Applied:**

1. "Weeks to integrate Veriff" → 6-12 hours (autonomous Cursor + Replit)
2. "SB 3 veto = prohibition" → Replaced by GA-56 regulation (not ban)
3. "Can't start without perfect testing" → Staging + incremental monitoring sufficient
4. "Veriff vs Veriff confusion" → Veriff replaces Veriff for biometric IDV (clear strategy)
