---

## WHAT I NEED FROM YOU, JESSE

**Share next batch of songs from your 84 Liked Songs:**
- Send 10-15 Suno links
- Focus on these themes:
  - FOR "ACT AS IF": Hustle, grind, struggle, dreams, betting on yourself, building
  - FOR "UNTIL YOU BECOME": Made it, transformation, unity, celebration, pride

**Format:** Just paste the Suno URLs, 2-3 at a time for focused analysis

---

## THE ALBUMS EXPLAINED (30 SECONDS)

**"Act as IF"** = You're not there yet, but you act like you are. Grinding on highways, local delivery hustle, betting on yourself. High-energy hip-hop/trap with Texas twang. The journey TO success.

**"Until YOU Become"** = You made it. Transformation complete. You ARE it now. Celebration with your people, Texas pride, looking back on the journey. Anthemic rock/country-pop. The arrival AT success.

**Together:** Complete hero's journey from hustle to arrival.

---

## SELECTION CRITERIA (What Makes the Cut?)

Every song needs:
- Production Quality: 7+/10 ✓
- Hook Strength: 7+/10 ✓
- Theme Alignment: 8+/10 ✓ (Perfect fit for album story)
- Replay Value: 7+/10 ✓ (People play it repeatedly)
- Energy Fit: Matches album vibe ✓

**If it doesn't pass all checks:** We save it for a different album, not force it

---

## YOUR GENIUS SHOWING THROUGH

**Texas Made (6 versions!)** = Your iteration process is fire
- v1-v4: Anthemic rock versions
- v5-v6: Hip-hop trap versions
- Result: TWO distinct songs from one concept

**Takeaway:** Don't throw away versions - they might be different songs for different albums

---

## SINGLES STRATEGY (Money Shots)

### From "Act as IF"
1. **Highways & Hustle v2** - Lead single (crossover appeal)
2. **Texas Made v6** - Hip-hop market single

### From "Until YOU Become"
1. **Built Different v2** - Lead single (festival anthem)
2. **Lone Star Party v2** - Summer single (TikTok-ready)

**Diptych Move:** Release one from each album simultaneously - show both sides of the journey

---

## TEXAS BRAND = YOUR SUPERPOWER

**Every single song analyzed has Texas identity.** That's not a coincidence - that's your brand.

**What this means:**
- Authentic (you're FROM Texas, not faking it)
- Unique angle (Texas transformation journey)
- Growing market (Texas hip-hop + country fusion)
- Loyal fanbase potential (regional pride is real)

**Keep leaning into Texas themes** - it's working

---

## THE 10X JARVIS SYSTEM (How We Analyze)

**What it is:** Deep analysis - 50-70 min per song, 3 listening rounds, 2-3 songs at a time

**Why it works:**
- First listen ≠ real understanding
- Iteration reveals what's actually special
- Prevents bad selections from snap judgments
- Respects your 386-song body of work

**You don't need to do this** - just know we're being thorough with your catalog

**Week 3-4:** Mastering, artwork, distribution setup
**Week 5-6:** Singles drop, build hype, full album release

**Doable?** Yes, if we keep momentum going

---

## WHAT GAPS WE NEED TO FILL

### For "Act as IF" (4-8 more tracks needed)

**Specific needs:**
1. Epic opener (if Highways & Hustle moves to Track 2)
2. Struggle/doubt moment (Track 6 - the hard times)
3. The comeback (Track 7 - getting back up)
4. Betting on yourself anthem (Track 8 - all-in moment)
5. The threshold (Track 10 - on edge of transformation)

**Vibe:** High energy, modern hip-hop/trap, Texas hustle stories

---

### For "Until YOU Become" (3-7 more tracks needed)

**Specific needs:**
1. Transformation moment (Track 1 - the shift from hustle to arrival)
2. "We made it" establishment (Track 2-3 - early arrival energy)
3. Reflection or celebration (Track 5-6 - looking back or partying)
4. Epic closer (Track 10 - leave them with "we ARE it now")

**Vibe:** Anthemic, celebratory, unity/partnership themes, confident

---

## DECISION-MAKING SHORTCUTS

**"Should this song be on an album?"**
→ Does it pass all 5 quality gates? (See Selection Criteria above)

**"Which album does it go on?"**
→ Hustle/grind/building energy = "Act as IF"
→ Made it/celebration/unity = "Until YOU Become"

**"Which version should we use?"**
→ Usually the later version (v2, v3, etc.) is more polished
→ But listen to both - sometimes different vibes = different albums (like Texas Made)

**"Is this a single?"**
→ Hook strength 9+/10 + commercial appeal + TikTok/festival potential = yes

---

## YOUR NUMBERS (IMPRESSIVE)

## FINAL WORD

**Jesse, you've already done the hard part** - you created 386 songs. That's the heavy lift.

Now we're just:
1. Analyzing them systematically (10X Jarvis)
2. Selecting the best ones (quality gates)
3. Arranging them into a story (Diptych albums)
4. Releasing them to the world (distribution)

**The music exists. The quality is there. The concept is strong.**

All we need: More songs from you to analyze.
