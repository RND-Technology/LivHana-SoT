## KEY CONCEPTS

### The Diptych
Two albums, one transformation story:
- **"Act as IF"** = The hustle phase (hip-hop/trap sound)

### 10X Jarvis Analysis
Deep, iterative song analysis:
- 2-3 songs at a time
- 3 rounds per song (Initial → Comparative → Refinement)
- 50-70 minutes per song
- Quality over speed

### Quality Gates
Every selected track must meet:
- Production Quality: 7+/10
- Hook Strength: 7+/10
- Theme Alignment: 8+/10
- Replay Value: 7+/10
- Energy Fit: Matches album profile

### Song Families
Multiple versions of the same song grouped together:
- Example: Texas Made (v1-v6)
- Compare versions, select best for album

## TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Focus on Liked Songs First:** 84 pre-filtered by Jesse = higher quality
2. **Use 10X Jarvis:** Don't rush, depth matters
3. **Maintain Quality Gates:** Better to have 8 excellent tracks than 10 okay tracks
4. **Document Everything:** You won't remember details with 386 songs
5. **Compare Versions:** Often v2 or later is better
6. **Trust the Process:** 50-70 min per song seems long, but it's worth it
7. **Think About Flow:** Consider how tracks work together, not just individually

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Why 2-3 songs at a time?**
A: Prevents analysis fatigue, allows deep focus, sustainable pace

**Q: Why 3 rounds per song?**
A: First impression ≠ complete understanding, iteration reveals layers

**Q: What if a song doesn't meet quality gates?**
A: Shortlist it or archive it, don't force it into the album

**Q: Can we use songs from outside the 84 Liked Songs?**
A: Yes, but start with Liked Songs (pre-filtered quality), then expand if needed

**Q: What if we find more than 10 tracks per album?**
A: Deluxe edition, B-sides, or save for future albums

**Q: How do we know if energy flow is right?**
A: Check energy maps in ALBUM_SELECTION_DIPTYCH.md, test listening sessions

## PHILOSOPHY

**Jesse has created 386 songs.** That's not just output - that's a body of work.

Each song deserves real consideration. The Diptych albums will represent Jesse's first major release. Every track needs to be undeniable. The story needs to be clear. The production needs to be excellent.

**10X Jarvis is about respect:**
- Respect for the creative output
- Respect for the time invested
- Respect for the transformation journey

**This isn't rushed.**
- Quality over speed
- Depth over breadth
- The right albums over fast albums

---

## CIRCLE OF SELF CREATION

**Act as IF:** Analyzing with professional rigor = acting like the artist you're becoming

**Until YOU Become:** Building real discography = becoming the artist

This process IS the transformation.
