## üè™ ALICE TEXAS OPERATIONS: CRITICAL ISSUES

### Issue #1: ReggieAndDroAlice.com - SITE DOWN

**Problem**: DNS failure, site completely down
**Action Required**:

- Access Cloudflare DNS settings for ReggieAndDroAlice.com
- Diagnose DNS configuration issue
- Restore site availability

**Priority**: HIGH (customers cannot access site)

### Issue #2: LightSpeed Replica for Alice Location

**Current State**:

- ReggieAndDro.com = Square website (main location)
- Alice location uses Square for inventory/POS
- Need: Separate branded site for Alice location

**Required**:

- Duplicate LightSpeed site architecture
- Pull Alice-specific inventory from Square
- Configure for Alice location branding
- Maintain sync with Square inventory

**Data Sources**:

- Square Alice location inventory (access via Rube MCP)
- ReggieAndDroAlice.com form fills (customer data)
- [PURGED_FALLACY] verification data (age/ID verification)

### Issue #3: Dragon + Brickweed Breakdown Strategy

**Problem**:

- Dragon (buyer) and Alice location requesting brickweed in grams
- Breaking into grams = too labor intensive
- Labor cost kills ROI
- Not sustainable for scaling

**Solution**:

- **Minimum**: 1/8 oz (3.5g) breakdown
- **Scale Options**: 1/8 oz ‚Üí 1/2 oz ‚Üí 1 oz
- **Benefits**:
  - Faster product movement
  - Lower labor costs
  - Better COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
  - Maintains margin integrity

**Implementation**:

- Update Square product configurations
- Communicate new minimums to Dragon
- Price optimization for bulk tiers
- Marketing: "Better value at eighth ounce+"

### Issue #4: Supply Chain 3PL Scaling

**Requirement**: Just-in-time inventory strategy for rapid 3PL expansion
**Goals**:

- Under-promise, over-deliver
- Scalable fulfillment
- Procurement efficiency
- Manufacturing coordination

**Charlie's Need**: Dashboard showing:

- Current inventory levels (by location)
- Fulfillment capacity
- Reorder triggers
- Supplier lead times
- Optimal order quantities

#### Option 4: Progressive Web App (PWA)

**Pros**:

- Works on any device
- Browser-based (no app store)
- Voice through browser APIs

**Cons**:

- Dependent on browser capabilities
- No offline mode

**Decision Needed**: Which path for initial deployment?
