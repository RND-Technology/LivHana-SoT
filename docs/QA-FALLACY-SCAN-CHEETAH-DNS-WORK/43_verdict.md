### Verdict:
**"Mission accomplished by accident, not by design."**

The domains work because GoDaddy's API is defensive and auto-corrects invalid configurations. This masked the fundamental DNS misunderstanding. In a different environment (different DNS provider, stricter API), this approach would have failed completely.

**Recommendation:** Implement Solution 2 (www CNAME + @ forwarding) within 24 hours to ensure:
1. Proper load distribution
2. Valid DNS configuration
3. Future-proof architecture
