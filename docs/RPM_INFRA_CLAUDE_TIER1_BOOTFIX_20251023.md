=== RPM INFRASTRUCTURE ENTRY ===
Date: 2025-10-23
Priority: HIGH (CRITICAL - Infrastructure Blocker)
Status: IN PROGRESS
Category: INFRA-TIER1-BOOT

## RESULT COMMITTED

Restore claude-tier1 bootup system to fully operational status with all 5 agents spawning correctly and START.sh executing complete initialization sequence without failures.

## PURPOSE (Why This Matters)

The claude-tier1 boot system is the central nervous system for the entire LivHana autonomous operation ecosystem. When bootup fails:
- All 5 foundation agents (Planning, Research, Artifacts, Execution, QA) cannot spawn
- Voice orchestration cannot coordinate agent activities
- RPM tracking and progress monitoring is disrupted
- Development velocity drops to zero (manual intervention required)
- Jesse CEO loses real-time operational intelligence

This is a SHOW-STOPPER that blocks all downstream work. Fixing it unblocks $439K-$729K in strategic value delivery.

## MASSIVE ACTION PLAN (MAP)

### FUNNEL STAGE: Middle of Funnel - Active Debugging & Implementation

### ACTIONS (Prioritized by Impact)

#### 1. ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION - HIGH PRIORITY
- [IN PROGRESS] Analyze START.sh script execution flow (lines 19-152)
  - Current Status: START.sh calls claude_tier1_boot.sh (line 21-25)
  - Blocker: claude_tier1_boot.sh may be failing silently
  - Evidence: SESSION_PROGRESS.md shows successful boots but agents not spawning
  - Next Step: Run START.sh with verbose logging to capture failure point

- [PENDING] Examine claude_tier1_boot.sh agent spawn logic
  - Location: /Users/jesseniesen/LivHana-Trinity-Local/LivHana-SoT/scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh
  - Verify: Lines 583-599 (agent auto-launch code per SESSION_PROGRESS)
  - Check: tmux session creation logic for 5 agents
  - Validate: agent_status/*.json file creation and lock handling

- [PENDING] Review agent spawn dependencies
  - Check Node version (requires v20 per .nvmrc)
  - Verify tmux availability and session isolation
  - Validate tmp/agent_status/ directory permissions
  - Confirm no zombie processes blocking session names

#### 2. ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION - HIGH PRIORITY
- [PENDING] Verify Node.js version persistence
  - Required: Node v20 (locked in .nvmrc)
  - Current: Unknown (need to verify with `node -v`)
  - Risk: Node v24 may cause incompatibilities
  - Fix: Ensure `nvm use 20` runs before agent spawn

- [PENDING] Validate MAX_AUTO configuration
  - Default: MAX_AUTO=1 (auto-start enabled)
  - Check: Environment variable not being overridden
  - Verify: Boot script reads and respects MAX_AUTO setting

- [PENDING] Check preflight system health
  - Redis connectivity (required by integration-service)
  - JWT_SECRET availability (1Password integration)
  - GCP authentication (high@reggieanddro.com)
  - Homebrew path configuration

#### 3. AGENT SPAWN SYSTEM ANALYSIS - CRITICAL
- [PENDING] Trace agent spawn execution path
  - Entry point: claude_tier1_boot.sh lines 583-599
  - Agent list: planning, research, artifact, execmon, qa
  - Spawn mechanism: tmux sessions with status file creation
  - Success criteria: 5 tmux sessions running + 5 status JSON files

- [PENDING] Verify tmux session management
  - Check existing sessions: `tmux list-sessions`
  - Identify conflicts: existing sessions blocking new spawns
  - Validate isolation: each agent in separate named session
  - Confirm watcher: voice orchestrator watcher operational

- [PENDING] Analyze status file coordination
  - Location: tmp/agent_status/{planning,research,artifact,exec,qa}.status.json
  - Lock mechanism: .{agent}.status.json.lock files
  - Race conditions: multiple spawn attempts conflicting
  - Cleanup strategy: stale locks from previous failed boots

#### 4. FIX IMPLEMENTATION - CRITICAL
- [PENDING] Implement identified fixes based on investigation
  - Address root cause systematically
  - Apply lessons from SESSION_PROGRESS (Implement → Verify → Lock)
  - Ensure fixes are permanent (not session-specific)
  - Document all changes with commit messages

- [PENDING] Test fixes in isolation
  - Kill all existing agent sessions
  - Clean tmp/agent_status/ directory
  - Run START.sh from clean state
  - Verify all 5 agents spawn successfully

- [PENDING] Validate end-to-end boot sequence
  - Run complete boot: `./START.sh dev`
  - Confirm preflight checks pass
  - Verify agent spawn completes
  - Check voice orchestrator activation
  - Test service health endpoints

#### 5. TESTING & VALIDATION - HIGH PRIORITY
- [PENDING] Execute comprehensive boot testing
  - Cold boot test (system restart scenario)
  - Warm boot test (agents already running)
  - Failure recovery test (simulate crash scenarios)
  - Performance test (boot time < 30 seconds target)

- [PENDING] Validate agent coordination
  - Check inter-agent protocol files
  - Verify JSON status file updates
  - Test funnel.ready mechanism
  - Confirm codex_tasks.json processing

- [PENDING] Document success criteria
  - All 5 tmux sessions running
  - All 5 status JSON files created
  - Voice watcher operational
  - Health probe script passes
  - Integration service responding on :3005
  - Reasoning gateway responding on :4002

## BLOCKERS & DEPENDENCIES

### CURRENT BLOCKERS
1. **CRITICAL**: claude-tier1 bootup currently failing
   - Impact: All agent operations blocked
   - Urgency: HIGH - blocks all strategic work
   - Owner: RPM Planning Administrator (active investigation)

2. **HIGH**: Awaiting investigation results from multiple agents
   - Planning Agent: Architecture analysis
   - Research Agent: Historical context (SESSION_PROGRESS patterns)
   - Execution Agent: System state validation
   - QA Agent: Test scenario preparation

### DEPENDENCIES
- Node v20 environment (via nvm)
- tmux installed and operational
- Redis server running (localhost:6379)
- GCP authentication configured
- 1Password CLI for secrets (optional)

## RISK REGISTER

### FALLACY RISKS IDENTIFIED
1. **Assumption**: "Boot script worked before, so environment must be the issue"
   - Reality: Script may have latent bugs that only manifest under certain conditions
   - Mitigation: Verify script logic systematically, don't assume past success

2. **Assumption**: "Agents are independent, so spawn failures are isolated"
   - Reality: Agents share coordination files and may have race conditions
   - Mitigation: Check for lock file conflicts and coordination protocol integrity

3. **Assumption**: "MAX_AUTO=1 means agents will always spawn"
   - Reality: Silent failures in spawn logic may not surface as errors
   - Mitigation: Add explicit logging and error handling to spawn code

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR JESSE CEO

### SITUATION
The claude-tier1 boot system is currently experiencing a failure that prevents the 5 foundation agents from spawning. This blocks all autonomous operations and requires immediate investigation and remediation.

### INVESTIGATION STATUS
- Root cause analysis: IN PROGRESS
- Investigation approach: Systematic trace through START.sh → claude_tier1_boot.sh → agent spawn logic
- Evidence gathering: SESSION_PROGRESS.md shows successful historical boots, suggesting recent regression
- Multiple agents coordinating: Planning, Research, Execution working in parallel

### IMPACT
- **Immediate**: All agent-driven work blocked
- **Strategic**: $439K-$729K value delivery at risk
- **Operational**: Manual intervention required for all tasks
- **Team**: Development velocity reduced to zero

### TIMELINE
- Investigation Started: 2025-10-23 06:41:11 CDT
- Expected Resolution: Within current session (target: <2 hours)
- Testing Phase: +30 minutes for validation
- Documentation: +15 minutes for commit and RPM update

### NEXT CHECKPOINT
- Provide root cause findings within 30 minutes
- Present fix implementation plan for approval
- Execute fixes and validate
- Report completion with evidence

## CROSS-ECOSYSTEM CONNECTIONS

### UPSTREAM DEPENDENCIES
- RPM Weekly Plan (OCT21-27): Blocked on Tier-1 operational status
- Agent Builder Implementation: Requires functioning agent spawn
- Voice Orchestration: Depends on agent availability
- TRUTH Pipeline: Needs agent coordination operational

### DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS
- VIP Dashboard: Cannot deploy without agent QA validation
- Compliance Service: Blocked on deployment coordination
- LightSpeed Integration: Needs agent orchestration for testing
- Music Tokenization: Requires stable agent infrastructure

## LESSONS LOCKED (Per Meta-Lessons Framework)

### PRINCIPLES APPLIED
1. **Implement → Verify → Lock**: Not just analyzing, will implement permanent fix
2. **Stay in Role**: RPM Planning Administrator coordinating, not coding directly
3. **Protocol over Glue**: Using agent status files and coordination protocol
4. **Finish What You Start**: Will see this through to verified completion
5. **Trust the Architecture**: 5-agent foundation has worked, will restore it

### FALLACY PREVENTION
- Not assuming past success means current correctness
- Not over-analyzing without testing hypotheses
- Not implementing without verification
- Not declaring complete without evidence

## RPM WEEKLY PLAN INTEGRATION

## APPENDIX: TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### START.sh Analysis (Key Sections)
```bash
# Line 21-25: Tier-1 boot invocation
if [ -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh" ]; then
  bash "$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh"
else
  echo "⚠️  Tier-1 boot script not found, proceeding with basic preflight..."
fi
```

### Expected Agent Spawn Behavior
1. claude_tier1_boot.sh executes
2. Environment checks pass (Node 20, Redis, GCP auth)
3. MAX_AUTO=1 detected (default)
4. Agent spawn loop initiates (lines 583-599)
5. Each agent gets tmux session + status file
6. Voice watcher starts monitoring agent activity
7. Health probe confirms all systems operational

### Current Failure Point (HYPOTHESIS)
- Boot script executing but not spawning agents
- Possible causes: tmux conflicts, lock file issues, silent failures in spawn logic
- Investigation will trace execution with verbose logging
