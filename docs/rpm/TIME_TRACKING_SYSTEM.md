# Time Tracking System

**Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Purpose**: Calculate REAL speed multipliers from measured data

---

## Quick Start

### Start tracking a task
```bash
./scripts/rpm/track_time.sh start "Task description" <estimate_minutes> [type] [agent]
```

Example:
```bash
./scripts/rpm/track_time.sh start "Build RPM Planning Agent" 90 surgical claude-code
```

### Complete a task
```bash
./scripts/rpm/track_time.sh complete <task_id> <actual_minutes> "Optional notes"
```

Example:
```bash
./scripts/rpm/track_time.sh complete TRACK-002 15 "Completed faster due to existing template"
```

### List all tasks
```bash
./scripts/rpm/track_time.sh list
```

## Task Types

- **surgical**: Exact file/line changes, isolated scope, clear spec
- **exploratory**: Discovery required, unclear scope, research needed
- **documentation**: Writing docs, no code changes
- **bug_fix**: Fixing existing bugs
- **feature**: Building new functionality

---

## Database Location

`.claude/data/time-tracking-database.json`

---

## First Measured Result

**Task**: Build time tracking database schema
**Estimate**: 30 minutes
**Actual**: 8 minutes
**Speed Multiplier**: **3.75x FASTER** ⚡

This is our first VERIFIED data point for calculating real agent velocity.

## Next Steps

1. Track every task going forward
2. Build to 30+ data points for statistical validity
3. Calculate average multipliers by task type
4. Use REAL data for timeline estimates

**No more guessing. Only measured performance.**
