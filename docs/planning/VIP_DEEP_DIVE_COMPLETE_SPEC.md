### Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Document ID**: PRD-VIP-001
**Product**: CEO Strategic Command Dashboard
**Owner**: Liv Hana Product Team
**Status**: APPROVED

#### Problem Statement

Jesse (CEO) experiences information overload from multiple data sources (financial, operational, strategic). He needs a single, voice-controlled interface that surfaces only critical information required for executive decision-making, accessible while mobile.

#### Goals & Success Metrics

**Business Goals**:
1. Reduce Jesse's time spent on information gathering (from 2 hours/day to 15 minutes/day)
2. Enable faster strategic decisions (from days to hours)
3. Increase autonomy of operations team (via better visibility)

**Success Metrics**:
- Daily active usage: 5+ sessions/day
- Average session duration: <2 minutes (quick check-ins)
- Voice command accuracy: >95%
- Decision latency: Reduce by 50% (measured via survey)

#### User Stories

**US-CEO-001**: As Jesse, I want to see today's revenue at a glance, so I can assess daily performance without opening multiple reports.
**US-CEO-002**: As Jesse, I want to ask "Liv, what's blocking Andrew?" via voice, so I can get instant updates while driving.
**US-CEO-003**: As Jesse, I want to see critical threats immediately, so I can respond before they escalate.
**US-CEO-004**: As Jesse, I want to approve strategic opportunities with one click, so execution doesn't wait for my return to the office.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Dashboard loads in <1 second
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours downtime/year max)
- **Security**: All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest
- **Scalability**: Handle 100 concurrent WebSocket connections (future VIPs)
- **Accessibility**: Voice-first (WCAG 2.1 AA not required, custom interface)

#### Out of Scope (This Release)

- ❌ Mobile app (desktop web only)
- ❌ Historical data visualization (graphs, charts)
- ❌ Direct CRM integration (manual data entry)
- ❌ Multi-user collaboration (single-user dashboard)

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

**ADR-VIP-001: Use WebSocket for Real-Time Updates**

**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Deciders**: Liv Hana Architecture Team

**Context**:
CEO dashboard requires real-time updates (financial metrics, agent status, threats) without manual refresh. Options: HTTP polling, Server-Sent Events (SSE), WebSocket.

**Decision**:
Use WebSocket (ws:// protocol) for bidirectional real-time communication between dashboard and backend.

**Rationale**:
- Lower latency than HTTP polling (no request overhead)
- Bidirectional (supports voice commands + data push)
- Well-supported in modern browsers
- Existing implementation in dashboard-server.cjs

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Real-time updates without page refresh
- ✅ Low bandwidth usage (delta updates only)
- ❌ Requires WebSocket server (added complexity)
- ❌ Connection management (reconnect on drop)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- HTTP Polling: Rejected (high latency, wasteful)
- SSE: Rejected (one-way only, no voice commands)

---

**ADR-VIP-002: Use API Key Authentication (No OAuth)**

**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Deciders**: Liv Hana Security Team

**Context**:
VIP dashboards contain sensitive business data. Need authentication mechanism that balances security with usability for 7 users.

**Decision**:
Use simple API key authentication (HTTP Authorization header) instead of OAuth 2.0 or session-based auth.

**Rationale**:
- Small user base (7 VIPs, not thousands)
- Localhost deployment (reduced attack surface)
- No third-party identity provider needed
- Keys can be rotated easily (environment variable)
- Sufficient for pilot phase

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simple implementation (20 lines of code)
- ✅ Easy key rotation (restart server)
- ❌ No fine-grained permissions (all-or-nothing access)
- ❌ Key theft = full access (physical security critical)

**Security Mitigations**:
- Keys stored in environment variables (not code)
- HTTPS required in production
- IP whitelist (localhost + VPN only)
- Audit logging (all requests logged)

**Future Consideration**:
Migrate to OAuth 2.0 if scaling beyond 20 users.

---

**ADR-VIP-003: Voice Mode Direct HTTP (Not Queue-Based)**

**Status**: PROPOSED (pending fix implementation)
**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Deciders**: Liv Hana Performance Team

**Context**:
Current voice mode has 20-second latency due to BullMQ queue polling (5-second interval). CEO requires <2 second latency for voice interactions.

**Decision**:
Replace async queue-based voice processing with direct HTTP calls to reasoning-gateway for voice-initiated requests.

**Rationale**:
- Queues designed for batch processing (wrong use case for real-time voice)
- Direct HTTP eliminates 5-6 second queue polling overhead
- Frontend already uses direct HTTP in production (proven pattern)
- Voice requests are high-priority (should preempt batch jobs)

**Consequences**:
- ✅ <2 second latency achievable (measured)
- ✅ Simpler architecture (one less component)
- ❌ No request buffering (backend must handle spikes)
- ❌ Lost requests if backend down (no retry queue)

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Add new `/api/reasoning/voice` endpoint (priority path)
2. Update frontend to use new endpoint for voice
3. Keep queue for non-voice requests (maintain existing functionality)
4. Add request prioritization (voice > batch)

**Rollback Plan**:
If latency not improved, revert to queue and optimize polling interval.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

**ADR-VIP-004: Store Shop Data in PostgreSQL (Not Spreadsheet)**

**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Date**: 2025-10-30

**Context**:
Current shop data in Google Sheets (manual, error-prone). Need structured database for dashboard integration.

**Decision**:
Migrate shop data to PostgreSQL database with proper schema (shops table, samples table, deals table).

**Rationale**:
- Structured queries (filter, sort, aggregate)
- ACID compliance (no lost updates)
- Easy API integration (REST endpoints)
- Scalable (handle 100+ shops in future)

**Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE shops (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'active', 'pending', 'at_risk'
  contact_name VARCHAR(100),
  contact_phone VARCHAR(20),
  address TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE samples (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  shop_id INTEGER REFERENCES shops(id),
  product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  units_sent INTEGER NOT NULL,
  coa_status VARCHAR(20), -- 'pending', 'ready', 'failed'
  sent_date DATE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE deals (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  contact_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'prospect', 'negotiation', 'closed', 'lost'
  estimated_value DECIMAL(10,2),
  estimated_pounds DECIMAL(6,2),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Migration Plan**:
1. Export Google Sheets to CSV
2. Create PostgreSQL tables
3. Import CSV data (ETL script)
4. Validate data integrity (compare counts)
5. Switch dashboard to PostgreSQL API
6. Archive Google Sheets (read-only backup)

## RED TEAM SECURITY ANALYSIS

### SEC-VIP-001: API Key Theft Risk

**Threat**: Attacker steals DASHBOARD_API_KEY from environment variable

**Attack Vector**:
1. Compromise server (RCE vulnerability)
2. Read environment variables (`printenv`)
3. Use stolen key to access dashboards

**Impact**: HIGH
- Attacker can view all sensitive data (financial, operational, technical)
- No audit trail (uses legitimate key)

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
- Requires server compromise (hard)
- Environment variable security depends on host OS

**Mitigation**:
1. **Implemented**: HTTPS only (encrypt key in transit)
2. **Implemented**: Localhost binding (reduce attack surface)
3. **Recommended**: Key rotation every 90 days
4. **Recommended**: IP whitelist (VPN required in production)
5. **Future**: Migrate to OAuth 2.0 with short-lived tokens

**Residual Risk**: MEDIUM → LOW (after mitigations)

---

### SEC-VIP-002: Shared Key for Store Ops Team

**Threat**: One team member's device compromised, attacker gains store ops access

**Attack Vector**:
1. Steal iPad (physical theft)
2. Key stored in browser (localStorage or cookie)
3. Access dashboard as legitimate user

**Impact**: MEDIUM
- Attacker can view store sales data
- Cannot modify financial settings (low privilege)
- Audit logging tracks actions (but attacker uses legitimate identity)

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
- iPads physically accessible in store
- Employees may not lock devices

**Mitigation**:
1. **Recommended**: Device PIN/biometric lock (enforce policy)
2. **Recommended**: Session timeout (30 minutes idle)
3. **Future**: Individual user accounts (track who did what)
4. **Future**: Device registration (whitelist MAC addresses)

**Residual Risk**: MEDIUM (acceptable for pilot, must fix for production)

---

### SEC-VIP-003: WebSocket Man-in-the-Middle

**Threat**: Attacker intercepts WebSocket traffic, reads sensitive data

**Attack Vector**:
1. Position on same network (WiFi eavesdropping)
2. Capture WebSocket frames (unencrypted ws://)
3. Read financial/operational data in transit

**Impact**: HIGH
- Attacker sees all real-time data (revenue, shop status, etc.)
- Can replay captured frames (potential data manipulation)

**Likelihood**: LOW → HIGH (depends on network security)
- Low in office (secure WiFi)
- High in public WiFi (conferences, travel)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Critical**: Upgrade to wss:// (WebSocket over TLS)
2. **Implemented**: Localhost only (no remote access in pilot)
3. **Production**: VPN required (encrypted tunnel)
4. **Future**: Certificate pinning (prevent MITM with fake certs)

**Residual Risk**: HIGH → LOW (after wss:// upgrade)

---

### SEC-VIP-004: Denial of Service (Dashboard)

**Threat**: Attacker floods WebSocket connections, crashes dashboard server

**Attack Vector**:
1. Open 1000+ WebSocket connections to dashboard
2. Server runs out of memory/file descriptors
3. Dashboard becomes unresponsive for legitimate users

**Impact**: HIGH
- VIPs cannot access dashboards (operational disruption)
- No data loss (read-only system)
- Recovery: Restart dashboard server (~1 minute downtime)

**Likelihood**: LOW
- Requires network access (localhost only in pilot)
- Production: VPN mitigates external attacks

**Mitigation**:
1. **Recommended**: Connection limit (max 100 concurrent)
2. **Recommended**: Rate limiting (max 10 connections per IP per minute)
3. **Recommended**: Health check monitoring (auto-restart if down)
4. **Future**: CDN/load balancer (distribute load)

**Residual Risk**: LOW (acceptable with mitigations)

---

### SEC-VIP-005: SQL Injection (BD Dashboard)

**Threat**: Attacker injects SQL via shop search or sample tracking forms

**Attack Vector**:
1. Input malicious SQL in form field (e.g., shop name: `'; DROP TABLE shops; --`)
2. If query not parameterized, SQL executes
3. Data loss or unauthorized access

**Impact**: CRITICAL
- Database corruption (drop tables, modify data)
- Unauthorized access (extract sensitive data)
- Reputation damage (security breach)

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
- Depends on backend implementation (parameterized queries?)
- Common vulnerability (OWASP Top 10)

**Mitigation**:
1. **Critical**: Use parameterized queries (no string concatenation)
2. **Recommended**: Input validation (whitelist allowed characters)
3. **Recommended**: Principle of least privilege (dashboard DB user read-only where possible)
4. **Recommended**: Regular security scans (SQLMap, automated testing)

**Residual Risk**: LOW (if parameterized queries confirmed)

**Action Required**: CODE AUDIT of all database queries in dashboard backend
