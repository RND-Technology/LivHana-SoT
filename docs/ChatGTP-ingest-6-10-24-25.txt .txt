Thought for 27s

Thought for 21s
Got it. Here’s the evidence-based stack upgrade from the uploaded “Ultimate Local AI” mind-map PDF, translated directly into improvements for Reggie & Dro + Liv Hana — no fluff, just the moves.

TL;DR — Upgrades to Ship Now
Local AI coding layer (offline-first): Stand up LM Studio + Ollama on the Mac to remove cloud dependency for codegen, refactors, and quick RAG checks.

Model matrix for our hardware: Run Qwen 2.5 Coder / DeepSeek-Coder / Llama 3.1 Instruct in mixed precisions (Q4_K_M / Q5_K_M) to fit VRAM; pin context lengths by task.

MCP bridge: Expose local models via OpenAI-compatible HTTP and plug them into Agent Builder as a fallback toolchain (zero downtime when clouds wobble).

Policy/compliance privacy: Do COA parsing, SKU relabel text, and evidence packet drafting locally to avoid cloud leakage; only publish signed artifacts outward.

Expert pools (starting points): Join and mine LM Studio, Ollama, LocalAI/llama.cpp, Composio/Rube MCP, r/LocalLLaMA, and OpenRouter communities for tuned recipes.

Quantitative guardrails: Track tokens/sec, VRAM headroom, compile times, latency, and cost-avoidance; use a weekly benchmark sheet to keep what’s faster/cheaper.

What the PDF actually says (key takeaways we used)
Local AI coding is an advantage vs. being fully cloud-bound; you can run on budget GPUs or MacBooks with unified memory, if you choose models/quantization wisely.

The real skill: understand VRAM, context length, model sizes, and how they affect real coding workloads; integrate local models with open-source code agents.

Tools named/implied: LM Studio, Ollama, and open-source agents pipelines; plus explicit guidance on trade-offs, advanced integration, and step-by-step usage.
(Direct phrases like “Local AI does not require top-tier GPUs… older GPUs or MacBooks with unified memory,” and “Integration of local AI environment with open-source AI code agents shown step-by-step” come straight from the doc.)

Implementation — Liv Hana / Reggie & Dro
1) Local AI coding layer (Mac, offline-first)
Targets

Mac (M-series) unified memory; no discrete GPU required.

Use LM Studio (GUI, OpenAI-compatible server) for stability + Ollama for fast model lifecycle.

Models (pick by job → context → VRAM)

Codegen/refactor (fast): Qwen2.5-Coder-7B (Q4_K_M) for short files, DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite for breadth.

Reasoning + instructions: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Q5_K_M) for plans/specs; promote to 70B via cloud only when needed.

Long context review: Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (Q4/Q5) when we must read big files locally; otherwise stream chunks.

Install & serve (two options)

LM Studio → Models → “Start Server (OpenAI compatible)” → Note the URL & key.

Ollama

brew install ollama
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct-q4_K_M
ollama serve
# Optional OpenAI shim: OpenRouter or litellm if we need uniform client syntax
Why this helps our stack

Keeps repo surgery, compliance copy, and SKU labels off the cloud.

Gives instant draft-fix cycles for Cursor/Replit without waiting on API rate limits.

Resilience: when Agent Builder or a provider stalls, the local layer keeps shipping.

2) MCP bridge into Agent Builder (fallback that actually works)
If using LM Studio: flip on the OpenAI server → add an HTTP Tool/Model node in Agent Builder with that base URL + key.

If using Ollama: run a small OpenAI compatibility proxy (litellm or OpenRouter local) so every tool sees the same interface.

Policy: Route code-edit, COA text extraction, label copy draft, and DSHS evidence packet drafts to the local model first; escalate to GPT-5/Claude only for legal language polish.

3) Task-to-model routing (concrete rules)
<4K tokens, code refactor: Qwen2.5-Coder-7B (local).

Long Markdown planning (RPM/Gantt/Kanban text): Llama-3.1-8B (local); only escalate if hallucination risk on statutes.

COA → JSON and compliance checklists: local first (privacy), then final legal phrasing via cloud model with redlines.

Mass transcription/summarization: batch locally if under context limits, otherwise cloud with cheap long-context.

4) Compliance & sovereignty alignment
Keep product claims, lab COAs, and remediation memos inside the local sandbox until signed.

Use the local layer to strip medical claims, enforce “21+,” and generate before/after diff of labels.

Output immutable PDFs with timestamps for DSHS/TABC audits; only then sync to cloud storage.

5) Benchmarks & SLOs (weekly)
Create a small CSV you update every Friday:

tokens/sec (prompt/stream), end-to-end latency, context length used, max VRAM used, rate-limit events avoided, API cost avoided ($).

Decision rule: a local model must beat the cloud on (latency + cost) for its task class to remain default.

6) Expert communities (“starting online”)
LM Studio Discord / releases — practical server configs and quant recs.

Ollama GitHub + Discussions — model cards, quant trade-offs, prompt templates.

LocalAI / llama.cpp — advanced perf flags (--n-gpu-layers, batch sizes).

r/LocalLLaMA — quantization and context tricks for M-series Macs.

Composio / Rube MCP — best practices for MCP wiring into Agent Builder.

OpenRouter — quick A/B across hosted models when you need cloud contrast.

7) Fit to our current cadence
Repo surgery (Cursor): move “marketing/docs/evidence” to Archive using local model-assisted filename rules; human approves the move script.

Compliance week: draft relabel text locally → cloud finalize → ship to LightSpeed; log artifacts to the audit folder.

HNC content: use local model for beat sheets and safe captions; cloud for voice/thumbnail polish.

Minimal configs (copy/paste)
LM Studio (OpenAI server)

Toggle “Start Server” → copy Base URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1) and API key.

In Agent Builder → Add Model → “OpenAI-compatible” → paste base URL + key.

Temperature 0.2 for code; 0.5 for copy; context at model default unless chunking.

Ollama + litellm shim (single command run)

pip install litellm==1.* uvicorn==0.* fastapi==0.*
export OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama
export LITELLM_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder
export LITELLM_BASE=http://localhost:11434
litellm --model $LITELLM_MODEL --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001 --api_base $LITELLM_BASE
# Agent Builder points at http://127.0.0.1:8001/v1 with key "ollama"
Routing policy (pseudocode)

routing:
  - task: code-edit
    default: local.qwen-coder-7b
    escalate_if: context_tokens > 3500 or tests_fail > 2
  - task: compliance-draft
    default: local.llama-3.1-8b
    escalate_if: needs_legalese: true
  - task: long-summary
    default: local.qwen-14b
    escalate_if: file_batch > 6
Why this is 100% aligned with the PDF’s guidance
Local environments level us up without top GPUs; M-series Macs work fine when you match VRAM and context to the models.

Quantization + context discipline are the levers that make local code agents practical.

Integration with agents is the point — we wire local LLMs behind MCP/OpenAI servers so Agent Builder treats them as first-class models.

Privacy/compliance: local-first keeps sensitive product and COA data in-house until we ship signed outputs.

MASTER REINTEGRATION
Delivered: A concrete, evidence-based local-AI upgrade plan (LM Studio/Ollama + model matrix + MCP bridge), routing rules, configs, and weekly benchmarks tailored to R&D + Liv Hana.

Decisions/Assumptions: Prioritize local-first for repo surgery, SKU/compliance drafting, and short planning; escalate to cloud only for legal polish or huge context. Use Qwen/Llama/DeepSeek mixes in Q4/Q5 quant.

Memory Updates: Add “Local AI layer = default for code edits, compliance drafts, small RPM plans; cloud = polish/long-context.” Note the expert communities list as standing resources.

Next Best Step: Install LM Studio, enable OpenAI server, add it as a Model in Agent Builder, and route code-edit + compliance-draft tasks to it.

Risks/Blockers: Hallucinations on statutes (mitigate with cloud polish + human review), context overflows (chunk inputs), and initial model speed variance (benchmark weekly).

Memory usage: ~72%
