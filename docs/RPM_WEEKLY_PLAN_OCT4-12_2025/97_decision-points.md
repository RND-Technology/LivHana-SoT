#### **Decision Points:**

1. **If Conversion Rate <5%:**
   - Increase urgency (limited-time offers)
   - Simplify checkout further (remove unnecessary fields)
   - Add trust signals (reviews, money-back guarantee)

2. **If AOV <$100:**
   - Push bundles harder (email, banners)
   - Increase free shipping threshold ($75 â†’ $100)
   - Add "Customers also bought" upsells

3. **If Email Campaigns Underperform (Open <10%):**
   - A/B test subject lines (urgency vs. curiosity)
   - Segment more granularly (THCa vs. brick weed buyers)
   - Clean email list (remove inactive subscribers)

4. **If Fulfillment Issues:**
   - Hire temporary packing help
   - Optimize pick/pack workflow (batch processing)
   - Upgrade to commercial thermal printer (faster labels)
