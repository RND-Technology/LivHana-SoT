#### **Actions:**

1. **Stock Levels Review:**
   - Top 10 SKUs: Current stock, sell-through rate, reorder threshold
   - Brick weed: Demand spike analysis (did $40/oz drive volume?)
   - Edibles: Shelf life check, expiration date management

2. **Supplier Communication:**
   - Reorder top sellers (lead time: 1-2 weeks)
   - Negotiate volume discounts (if hitting higher order quantities)
   - Diversify suppliers (risk mitigation)

3. **New Product Scouting:**
   - THCa diamonds, live resin carts, other high-margin products
   - TerpWork.com synergy (can we offer terpene-infused flower?)
