Subject: Texas Hemp-Derived Terpenes — Myrcene-Dominant Extract Available

Hi [Name],

I'm Jesse with Terpwerk, and we've got something you might need: hundreds of liters of myrcene-dominant, hemp-derived terpene extract.

Quick specs:
- Source: Texas-grown hemp (DSHS licensed)
- Profile: High myrcene (relaxing, earthy notes)
- Purity: FEMA GRAS compliant, full COA available
- Volume: 100L+ available, bulk pricing $80-120/kg

Use cases:
- Vape cartridge formulation
- Edible flavoring (natural, non-synthetic)
- Extraction reintroduction (post-distillation)

Interested in a sample (10ml, $25 shipped)?

Let me know — happy to send COA + pricing sheet.

Best,
Jesse Niesen
