### 🔴 **PRIORITY 1: KAJA PAYMENT APPROVAL UNBLOCKING**

**Owner:** Jesse + Andrew  
**Timeline:** 2-4 hours execution  
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL — Blocking $100K+ revenue

#### **Immediate Actions (Execute Today):**

1. **Remove ALL "Weed" Verbiage from Site**
   - **Why:** Sam Wahba's blocker for bank review
   - **Action:** Search reggieanddro.company.site for "weed", "marijuana", "pot", "cannabis" (where not legally required)
   - **Replace with:** "hemp flower", "THCa flower", "legal hemp", "hemp-derived"
   - **Evidence:** Screenshot changes for Kaja review documentation
   - **Time:** 30 minutes

2. **Add Product Ingredients to ALL Edibles**
   - **Why:** Sam's Excel requirement for bank compliance
   - **Action:** Gummies, brownies, drinks, tinctures — full ingredient lists
   - **Format:** "Ingredients: [list]" in product descriptions
   - **Include:** Allergen warnings (e.g., "Contains: Tree nuts, Soy")
   - **Time:** 1 hour

3. **Upload Product Photos to ALL Products**
   - **Why:** Bank review requires visual verification
   - **Minimum:** 3 photos per product (product, packaging, close-up)
   - **Source:** Existing inventory or quick smartphone shots
   - **Platform:** Lightspeed product pages
   - **Time:** 1-2 hours

4. **Hide Accessories Temporarily**
   - **Why:** Sam's request — bank prefers pure hemp focus during review
   - **Action:** Smoking accessories, grinders, rolling papers → set to "hidden" in Lightspeed
   - **Note:** Re-enable post-approval
   - **Time:** 15 minutes

5. **DNS Flip Prep (DO NOT EXECUTE YET)**
   - **Contact:** Leanne Fonte (<lfonte@kajapayments.com>, 516-450-8214)
   - **Request:** SSL support for reggieanddro.com → reggieanddro.company.site
   - **Get:** Cloudflare CNAME/A record instructions
   - **Critical:** DO NOT flip DNS until Kaja confirms ready for review
   - **Time:** 30 minutes (email + phone follow-up)

#### **Success Metric:**

✅ Site 100% compliant for bank review by 6pm PDT Friday

2. **Pirate Ship Investigation**

   - **Action:** Compare rates (USPS First Class, Priority, Priority Express)
   - **Decision Point:** If >15% savings, integrate via Lightspeed API
   - **Time:** 30 minutes research

3. **Order Shipping Supplies**
   - **Items:**
