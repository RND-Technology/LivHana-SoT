# ADR-012: One-Shot Prompt Engineering & VibeClient Architecture

## Status
**ACTIVE** - Core methodology for AI application development

## Context

During extensive development iterations, a critical pattern emerged: the need to create sophisticated prompts that can generate entire applications in a single execution, avoiding the costly trial-and-error cycles typical of iterative AI development. This methodology was crystallized through the development of the "VibeClient" application concept.

### Business Driver
- **Development Efficiency**: Eliminate multiple rounds of trial and error in AI-assisted development
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Enable replication of complex architectural patterns through single prompts
- **Quality Assurance**: Incorporate lessons learned to prevent recurring architectural mistakes
- **Scalable AI Development**: Create repeatable frameworks for rapid application generation

## Decision

### One-Shot Prompt Engineering Methodology

#### Core Principles
1. **Avoid Conversational Scaffolding**: Applications must not require complex multi-turn prompting logic
2. **Minimalist Architecture**: Favor single HTML files with inline CSS/JavaScript using lightweight frameworks
3. **State Management Focus**: Efficient capture, storage, and processing of conversation history is critical
4. **Synthesis Over Execution**: Generate master prompts rather than executing them
5. **Intuitive UI/UX**: Clean, simple interfaces with clear user flows

#### VibeClient Application Architecture

The VibeClient serves as the canonical example of this methodology:

**Purpose**: Allow users to iteratively refine concepts through conversational interface, ultimately producing a perfect one-shot prompt for generating their desired output.

**Core Components**:

1. **User Interface (UI)**: Clean chat interface with message input, send button, and distinct "Analyze Conversation & Generate Master Prompt" button

2. **Conversation Logic**: Client-side logic to append user/AI messages to conversation history, stored in localStorage

3. **Analysis & Synthesis Engine**: Sophisticated prompt formulation for LLM analysis of conversation patterns and generation of master prompts

4. **Output Display**: Clearly designated, copyable text area displaying the generated master prompt

#### Template Structure for One-Shot Prompts

```markdown
# One-Shot Command: Generate [Application Name]

## **Your Persona & Mandate**
You are an expert AI Application Architect and Senior Software Engineer. Your task is to generate a complete, functional full-stack application in a single response based on the comprehensive blueprint below. Do not simulate the process; **execute it.** Your output must be the final product.

## **Application Context & Core Purpose**
[Detailed description of application purpose and core functionality]

## **Architectural Principles & Constraints (Lessons Learned)**
Incorporate these hard-learned lessons to avoid past failures and unnecessary complexity:
1. [Specific constraint based on previous experience]
2. [Architecture simplification requirement]
3. [State management requirement]
4. [Focus limitation]
5. [UI/UX requirement]

## **Required Functional Components**
1. [Component 1 with specific requirements]
2. [Component 2 with specific requirements]
3. [Component 3 with specific requirements]
4. [Component 4 with specific requirements]

## **Final Deliverable Format**
Your response must be a single, ready-to-run HTML file that includes:
- Inline CSS for modern interface
- Inline JavaScript with lightweight framework via CDN
- Clear comments separating logical sections
- **No placeholders.** The code must be complete and functional
```

#### Parallelized Development Agent Blueprints

To accelerate development using specialized agents working in parallel:

**1. Agent: UI Component Architect**
```
Prompt: "You are a front-end specialist. Generate a clean, responsive chat UI component in a single HTML/Vue.js file. Include a scrollable message history area, a text input, a send button, and a separate 'Generate Master Prompt' button. Use Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling. Focus on reactivity and state management for the message array."
```

**2. Agent: State & Logic Engineer**
```
Prompt: "You are a JavaScript engineer. Write the logic for a client-side chat application. Create functions to: a) add a new user message to a state array, b) simulate an AI response (for now, echo a placeholder), c) save and load the conversation history from localStorage, and d) handle the click of a 'Generate' button. Provide this as a module-ready code block."
```

**3. Agent: Prompt Synthesis Specialist**
```
Prompt: "You are an expert LLM prompt engineer. Draft the *internal* prompt that the application will use to send the conversation history to an LLM API (like OpenAI). The prompt must expertly instruct the LLM to analyze the history and return a perfect one-shot prompt. The prompt must be parameterized with {conversationHistory}. Provide this as a well-commented JavaScript string."
```

**4. Master Architect Agent**
Integrates the work of the three sub-agents into the final, single HTML file.

## Prompt Engineering Blueprint Process

### Section 1: Context and Goal Definition
```
I am building a [describe your app] that allows users to iterate on their ideas through a back-and-forth conversational flow. The goal is to let users refine their app concept until it feels right and then produce a final prompt or output that they can use to generate the application in one go.
```

### Section 2: Challenges and Lessons Learned
```
In developing this app, I encountered several issues, including [mention specific issues: e.g., "repeated bugs in the conversation logic," "unnecessary architectural complexity," and "multiple rounds of trial and error that could have been skipped."] I realized I needed a single, well-crafted prompt that could guide the app creation in one shot, taking into account all these lessons.
```

### Section 3: Request for the Ideal Prompt
```
Please take on the persona of a prompt engineer and write a single comprehensive prompt I could have used from the start. This prompt should:
1. Explain the app's purpose and the desired conversational flow
2. Incorporate all the lessons learned so that the AI can generate the entire application or solution in one go
3. Avoid all the unnecessary steps and pitfalls I encountered

In other words, create a single, polished prompt that would have made this entire development process smooth and straightforward.
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Flow Optimization
1. **Pre-Development Analysis**: Catalog all potential pitfalls and architectural constraints before beginning
2. **Single-Shot Generation**: Use comprehensive prompts to generate complete functional applications
3. **Parallel Development**: Deploy specialized agents for concurrent development of different components
4. **Master Integration**: Combine parallel work through a master architect agent
5. **Quality Verification**: Validate output against original requirements without iterative debugging

### Code Architecture Standards
- **Single File Approach**: HTML with inline CSS/JavaScript unless complexity demands separation
- **CDN Dependencies**: Use lightweight frameworks via CDN to avoid build complexity
- **State Persistence**: Implement localStorage or similar for data preservation
- **No Placeholders**: Every generated component must be immediately functional
- **Clear Documentation**: Inline comments explaining each logical section

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Dramatic Development Speed**: Applications generated in single executions instead of iterative cycles
- **Higher Quality Output**: Lessons learned prevent recurring architectural mistakes
- **Reproducible Patterns**: One-shot prompts can be reused for similar applications
- **Parallel Efficiency**: Multiple specialized agents can work simultaneously
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Architectural patterns captured in reusable prompt templates

### Negative
- **Upfront Complexity**: Requires sophisticated understanding of target architecture before beginning
- **Prompt Engineering Overhead**: Creating effective one-shot prompts demands significant expertise
- **Limited Flexibility**: Single-shot approach may not accommodate mid-development requirement changes
- **Dependency on AI Capability**: Success depends on LLM's ability to handle complex, comprehensive instructions
