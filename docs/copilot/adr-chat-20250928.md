# Architectural Decision Record (ADR): Liv Hana E2E - September 2025 Critical Architectural Lessons

**Date:** 2025-09-28  
**Session:** Liv Hana E2E Mission, GitHub Enterprise/Copilot, System Blocker Debugging

---

## Context

This ADR compiles critical architectural, operational, and decision content from the multi-day troubleshooting, policy, and Single Source of Truth (SoT) sessions between Jesse (CEO) and Copilot, focused on unlocking durable knowledge and best practices for all Liv Hana agents and developers.

---

## Major Blockers and System Failures

- **Fine-Grained Token Creation Failure:** Unable to generate GitHub fine-grained personal access tokens for private organization-owned repositories, despite all enterprise/org settings set to “ALLOW”.  
- **Hidden Enterprise/Org Policy Hierarchy:** Unintuitive, poorly documented interplay between GitHub Enterprise and Organization policies; global “ALLOW” does not guarantee access propagation to org-level private repos.
- **Time Loss & Operational Drag:** Multiple days spent on redundant troubleshooting, wild goose chases, ambiguous UI and unhelpful documentation.  
- **Platform Bug or Limitation:** All correct policy settings still result in invisible org-level private repos in token creator UI—a deep GitHub platform flaw.

---

## Solutions Attempted

- **Exhaustive Policy Audit:** All enterprise/org settings set to “ALLOW”; approval flows disabled; admin exemptions toggled; cache cleared; browser swap; login/out; SSO checked.
- **Team/Org Permission Escalation:** Verified org owner/admin status and team-level permission grants.
- **Diagnostic Protocols:** Parallel checks for SSO, policy propagation, caching delay, and admin exemptions.
- **Workaround:** Temporary public repo visibility to unblock fine-grained token creation, followed by revert to private and escalation to GitHub Enterprise Support.

---

## Failures

- **Platform/Backend Bug:** No configuration resolves the blocker except risky public repo workaround; GitHub documentation does not cover this scenario.
- **Durable Knowledge Gaps:** Critical learnings risk being lost in chat unless immediately transcribed to docs/issues.

---

## Best Practices Established

- **Promote Durable Knowledge:** All critical architectural lessons, blockers, and resolutions to be transcribed into version-controlled docs (ADRs, playbooks, runbooks) in docs/copilot/.
- **Default to Verification:** Always verify existence and function of referenced scripts (e.g., ./scripts/check_trinity_status.sh), or refactor callers if not present.
- **Respect Guardrails:** Maintain compliance with 21+ guardrails, document all critical decisions in issues and docs.
- **Single Source of Truth Discipline:** Never leave critical insights buried in chat—immediately promote to docs + issues for all agents and stakeholders.
- **Copilot Custom Instructions:** Use GitHub Copilot Org Custom Instructions to enforce documentation discipline and best practices.

---

## Analysis

### GitHub Fine-Grained Token Bug

- **Symptom:** Private org repos do not appear for fine-grained PAT creation, even with global “ALLOW” everywhere.
- **Impact:** Blocks secure, granular automation and integrations; forces risky workarounds.
- **Immediate Action:** Use public repo workaround only for urgent unblock; revert to private and escalate to GitHub support.

### Enterprise/Org Policy Hierarchy

- **Finding:** Enterprise-level “ALLOW” overrides org delegation, but propagation is unreliable; settings are not intuitive.
- **Practice:** Always check and document both enterprise and org-level state.

### Public Repo Workaround

- **Process:** Temporarily set repo public → create token → revert to private.
- **Risk:** Brief exposure—ensure code has no secrets before toggling.
- **Action:** Use only if mission-critical; escalate for permanent fix.

### Copilot Documentation Discipline

- **Instruction:** Codify architectural learnings and troubleshooting in docs/copilot/ and issues/ for durability.
- **Reference:** Copilot Organization Custom Instructions (https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-organization-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot)

### Durable Knowledge Playbook

- **Strategy:** Transcribe all chat learnings to docs (ADRs, playbooks, runbooks) immediately.
- **Maintenance:** Regularly review and update docs to reflect evolving best practices and architectural changes.

---

## Next Steps

- Execute public repo workaround to unblock fine-grained token creation if needed.
- Immediately revert repos to private status after token generation.
- Escalate bug to GitHub Enterprise Support for permanent resolution.
- Continue promoting all architectural lessons and decision content from chat to docs/copilot/ and issues/ for Single Source of Truth durability.
