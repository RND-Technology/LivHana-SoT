# ADR-013: RPM Visioneering Cascade Framework

## Status
**ACTIVE** - Core organizational methodology for all business and technical operations

## Context

The RPM (Results-Purpose-Massive Action) Visioneering Cascade represents Jesse Niesen's proprietary "Remembering the Future" methodology, systematically extracted and codified from extensive planning sessions. This framework provides the foundational structure for all Liv Hana operations, from high-level strategic planning to detailed technical implementation.

### Business Driver
- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensure all technical and business initiatives align with core vision
- **Systematic Execution**: Replace reactive management with proactive, planned operations  
- **Measurable Progress**: Implement trackable progression across all Areas of Mastery
- **Organizational Coherence**: Unify R&D, HNC, OPS, and HERB divisions under single framework

## Decision

### Core Architecture: Visioneering Cascade System

```
VISIONEERING CASCADE:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RPM (PRIMARY) ‚Üí Results, Purpose, Massive Action [Initial Vision]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AOM (AREAS OF MASTERY) ‚Üí 8 Strategic Categories Analysis  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ COI (CATEGORIES OF IMPROVEMENT) ‚Üí Wheel of Life Business Assessment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RPM (SECONDARY) ‚Üí Refined Results, Purpose, Massive Action [Validated Vision]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HIGH FIVE VALIDATION ‚Üí Five-Finger Reality Check System
```

### Wheel of Life Progression Matrix
Applied to ALL organizational elements:
- **Level 0**: Baseline/Problem state (Where you started)
