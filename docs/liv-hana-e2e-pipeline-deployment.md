  const { birthDate, customerInfo } = req.body;
  
  try {
    const today = new Date();
    const birth = new Date(birthDate);
    const age = calculatePreciseAge(today, birth);
    const isVerified = age >= 21; // Texas hemp law
    
    const verificationLog = {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      customerEmail: customerInfo.email,
      ageCalculated: age,
      verificationResult: isVerified,
      ipAddress: req.ip,
      complianceId: `TX-${Date.now()}`
    };
    
    await logVerification(verificationLog);
    
    if (isVerified) {
      const sessionToken = generateSecureToken(customerInfo);
      res.json({
        verified: true,
        age: age,
        sessionToken: sessionToken,
        message: "Age verification successful - Welcome to Reggie & Dro",
        redirectUrl: "/shop",
        complianceId: verificationLog.complianceId
      });
    } else {
      res.json({
        verified: false,
        age: age,
        message: "You must be 21+ to purchase hemp products in Texas",
        redirectUrl: "/age-restriction",
        complianceId: verificationLog.complianceId
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Verification error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
