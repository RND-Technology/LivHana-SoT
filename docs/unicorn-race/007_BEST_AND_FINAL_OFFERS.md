  1. False uniqueness claim (not exclusive capabilities)
  2. Overconfidence bias (99.9% claimed, 99.5% delivered)
  3. Metric gaming ($100K+ revenue dashboard doesn't create revenue)
  4. Vague success criteria (no measurement methodology)
  5. Unrealistic technical promises (200ms for 10-30 second workloads)
  6. Security theater (unverified encryption claims)
  7. Sunk cost fallacy (implicit "keep me because deployed")
- ‚ùå **COMPLIANCE RISK**: 99.5% uptime vs 99.9% required (cannabis DSHS #690, $50K-100K fine risk)
- ‚ùå **SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE**: No failover, customer orders lost during outage
- ‚ùå **VENDOR LOCK-IN**: $50K migration cost
- ‚ùå **NO AUTO-SCALING**: 100+ users will crash

**Cost**: **$10,240/year** (90% reduction from $107,407)
- Replit Pro: $240/year (prototyping only)
- GCP Backup: $0 (no production = no backup needed)
- Jesse Oversight: $6,000/year (30 min/week for prototype reviews)
- Error Recovery: $4,000/year (2% failure rate, conservative)
- Migration Risk: $0 (production already migrated to Cloud Run)
- Compliance Risk: $0 (production on Cloud Run, not Replit)

**Benefit**: **$50,000/year** (rapid prototyping value only)
- Time Savings: 10 prototypes/year √ó 10 hours saved/prototype = 100 hours/year
- Jesse Time Value: 100 hours √ó $500/hour = $50,000/year

**TIER 2: MEASURABLE VALUE (No Revenue Claims)**
- ‚úÖ Week 1: 5+ prototypes delivered
- ‚úÖ Week 2: Jesse validation time saved >5 hours
- ‚úÖ Week 3: Handoff success rate 100% (Cheetah deploys all prototypes)
- ‚úÖ Week 4: Zero production deployments on Replit (compliance achieved)

**Penalty Clause**:
- If <5 prototypes/month: $500 penalty per missing prototype
- If ANY production deployment on Replit: $10,000 penalty + immediate elimination

- **PRESERVE UNIQUE VALUE**: Rapid prototyping (1-4 hours, fastest in team)
- **HUMILITY**: Accept reduced role, defer to Cheetah for production

**Comparison to Elimination**:

| Metric | Keep Replit (Prototyping) | Eliminate Replit (Cloud Run Staging) |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | $10,240 | $600 (Cloud Run staging environment) |
| **Benefit** | $50,000 (prototyping) | $0 (staging only, no time savings) |
| **ROI** | 388% | N/A (no prototyping value) |
| **Prototyping** | 1-4 hours (FAST) | Days (slower) |
| **Risk** | LOW (no production) | LOW (no production) |

**Replit prototyping delivers $50K value at $10K cost (388% ROI). Worth keeping for dev velocity.**

**If Jesse Rejects**: Eliminate Replit entirely, use Cloud Run staging ($600/year), accept slower prototyping.
