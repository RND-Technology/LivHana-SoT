- **Assumption**: Based on GPT-4 Turbo pricing (~$10/1M input tokens, ~$30/1M output tokens)
- **Estimated Usage**: 24/7 monitoring, quality gates, coordination (~100M tokens/month)
- **Input**: 100M √ó $0.01 = **$1,000/month**
- **Output**: 10M √ó $0.03 = **$300/month**
- **Monthly Cost**: **$1,300/month** (estimated)
- **Annual Cost**: **$15,600/year**

**Note**: This is an ESTIMATE. GPT-5 pricing may be significantly higher or lower.

**2. Agent Builder Subscription (if required)**
- **Platform**: OpenAI Agent Builder (platform.openai.com)
- **Pricing**: UNKNOWN (Agent Builder pricing not public)
- **Assumption**: Similar to ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) OR included in API costs
- **Monthly Cost**: **$0 assumed** (bundled in API costs)
- **Annual Cost**: **$0**

**3. MCP Broker Infrastructure (GCP Cloud Run)**
- **Service**: mcp-broker-prod on Cloud Run
- **Cost**: Pay-per-request, ~$0.20/day for production use
- **Monthly Cost**: **$6/month**
- **Annual Cost**: **$72/year**

**4. Bearer Token Management (Secret Manager)**
- **Service**: op-service-account-token in GCP Secret Manager
- **Cost**: $0.06/secret/month
- **Monthly Cost**: **$0.06/month**
- **Annual Cost**: **$0.72/year**

**5. Maintenance/Oversight Costs**
- **Jesse CEO Time**: ~1 hour/week receiving reports, making final decisions
- **Hourly Value**: $500/hour (CEO opportunity cost)
- **Weekly Cost**: 1 hour √ó $500 = **$500/week**
- **Monthly Cost**: **$2,000/month**
- **Annual Cost**: **$24,000/year**

**Note**: HIGHER than Cheetah ($12,000) due to coordination overhead, but LOWER than Claude Code ($48,000).

**6. Contract Enforcement Overhead**
- **Reality**: Codex monitors all 3 agents (Claude Code, Cheetah, Replit)
- **Cost**: Computational overhead for quality gates, fallacy scanning, coordination
- **Estimated**: ~20% of API usage = $1,300 √ó 0.2 = **$260/month**
- **Annual Cost**: **$3,120/year**

**7. Error Recovery Costs (Agent Coordination)**
- **Reality**: If agents fail, Codex must coordinate recovery
- **Historical**: Claude Code 10% failure rate, others 0%
- **Estimated Recovery Time**: 2 hours/failure √ó 5 failures/month = 10 hours/month
- **Monthly Cost**: 10 hours √ó $500 (Jesse) = **$5,000/month**
- **Annual Cost**: **$60,000/year**

**Note**: This overlaps with Claude Code's error recovery cost. If Claude Code is eliminated, this cost drops to ~$0.

**8. Weekly Limit Hit (Potential)**

## üìä ROI CALCULATION

**Annual Benefit**: $609,051
**Annual Cost**: $105,193
**Net Value**: **$503,858/year**
**ROI**: ($609,051 - $105,193) / $105,193 = **479% ROI**

**Comparison**:
- **vs Claude Code**: 479% vs 46.3% = **10x BETTER ROI**
- **vs Cheetah**: 479% vs 2,462% = **5x WORSE ROI**

### ROI Sensitivity Analysis

**Best Case** (GPT-5 pricing is cheap, no agent errors):
- GPT-5 cost halved: -$7,800
- Agent error recovery eliminated: -$60,000
- **Adjusted Total Cost**: $37,393/year
- **ROI**: ($609,051 - $37,393) / $37,393 = **1,529% ROI**

**Worst Case** (GPT-5 pricing is expensive, high agent error rate):
- GPT-5 cost doubled: +$15,600
- Agent error recovery doubled: +$60,000
- **Adjusted Total Cost**: $180,793/year
- **Adjusted Benefit**: $609,051 (unchanged)
- **ROI**: ($609,051 - $180,793) / $180,793 = **237% ROI**

### Critical Contract Violation

**Contract Guarantee**: <$200/month for enforcement services
**Actual Estimated Cost**: $1,306/month (GPT-5 API only) + other costs
**Total Monthly Cost**: $8,766/month
**Contract Violation**: **43.8x over budget**

**Implication**: Codex is either:
1. Violating contract (overspending by 4,280%)
2. Contract guarantee is unrealistic (fallacy)
3. GPT-5 pricing estimate is wrong (unknown until release)

### Current Reality Check

**Proven Performance**: Beat Claude Code in head-to-head race (VICTORY)
**Current ROI**: **479%** (strong, but depends on GPT-5 pricing)
**Risk**: **SEVERE contract violation** if costs are accurate
