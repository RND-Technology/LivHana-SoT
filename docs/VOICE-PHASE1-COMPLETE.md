## JESSE'S IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### STEP 1: GRANT MICROPHONE PERMISSIONS

#### Option A: Use Direct Link (Fastest)
**Click this link or paste in browser:**
```
x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_Microphone
```

#### Option B: Manual Navigation
1. Press `Cmd + Space`
2. Type: `System Settings`
3. Press Enter
4. Click **"Privacy & Security"** in left sidebar
5. Scroll down and click **"Microphone"**
6. Find your terminal application in the list:
   - Terminal.app
   - iTerm
   - VS Code
   - Or whatever terminal you're using
7. **Toggle the switch to ON** (it will turn blue)
8. **CRITICAL:** Quit and restart your terminal application

### STEP 2: VERIFY MICROPHONE HARDWARE
1. Go to System Settings â†’ Sound â†’ Input
2. Check which microphone is selected (built-in or external)
3. Speak into microphone and watch input level meter
4. Ensure level shows activity when you speak

### STEP 3: RUN BASIC TEST
```bash
cd /Users/jesseniesen/LivHana-Trinity-Local/LivHana-SoT
./tests/voice/test_voice_basic.sh
```

**Expected:** You should hear spoken audio (TTS test)

### STEP 4: RUN PERMISSIONS TEST
```bash
./tests/voice/test_voice_permissions.sh
```

**Expected:** System speaks to you AND captures your voice response

### STEP 5: RUN INTERACTIVE TEST
```bash
./tests/voice/test_voice_interactive.sh
```

**Expected:** Natural back-and-forth conversation

## CURRENT SERVICE STATUS

**Whisper (Speech-to-Text):**
- Status: Running
- Port: 2022
- Ready: YES

**Kokoro (Text-to-Speech):**
- Status: Loaded (initializing)
- Port: 8880 (may take 10-30 seconds to fully bind)
- Ready: PENDING (wait 30 seconds then check)

If Kokoro still shows not listening after 30 seconds:
```bash
mcp__voicemode__service kokoro restart
sleep 30
mcp__voicemode__service kokoro status
```

---

## WHAT TO EXPECT

### If Permissions Are Granted Correctly:
1. TTS test: You hear clear speech
2. STT test: System captures your voice and shows transcription
3. Interactive test: Natural conversation flows

### If Permissions NOT Granted:
1. TTS test: Works (audio output)
2. STT test: FAILS with permission error or no input captured
3. Interactive test: Can't proceed

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE

**Problem: Can't hear audio**
- Check system volume
- Check Sound â†’ Output in System Settings
- Run: `mcp__voicemode__service kokoro status`

**Problem: Audio heard but voice not captured**
- Microphone permissions not granted â†’ Follow STEP 1
- Wrong microphone selected â†’ Check System Settings â†’ Sound â†’ Input
- Terminal not restarted â†’ Quit and restart terminal

**Problem: Both services show errors**
- Check logs: `mcp__voicemode__service whisper logs`
- Check logs: `mcp__voicemode__service kokoro logs`
- Restart both: `mcp__voicemode__service whisper restart && mcp__voicemode__service kokoro restart`
