## PART III: DECISION HISTORY

### **Major Pivots**

1. **From Prohibition Defense to Regulatory Advocacy (June 2025)**
   - Decision: Shift from opposing SB3 ban to proposing reasonable regulation
   - Rationale: Gov. Abbott's veto signal + public support data
   - Outcome: Executive Order GA-56 age restrictions vs total ban

2. **Congressional Briefing Focus (Sept 2025)**
   - Decision: Develop comprehensive 50-state analysis framework
   - Rationale: Federal movement opportunity via committee request
   - Resource Allocation: Full research sprint over 2 days

3. **Free Product for Activism Campaign (May 2025)**
   - Decision: Offer THCA flower for legislative contact
   - Rationale: Convert customer base to political action
   - Result: Dozens of participants, sustained business through crisis

### **Rejected Approaches**

1. **Pure CBD/CBG Pivot** - Would abandon THC market
2. **Out-of-State Relocation** - Lost Texas influence position
3. **Underground Market** - Incompatible with veteran values
4. **Litigation-Only Strategy** - Too slow for market preservation

### **Resource Allocation Decisions**

- Primary: Legislative monitoring/response
- Secondary: Online sales infrastructure
- Tertiary: Multi-state expansion planning
- Deferred: Franchise development

### **Timeline Adjustments**

- Accelerated: $100K/month target (crisis-driven urgency)
