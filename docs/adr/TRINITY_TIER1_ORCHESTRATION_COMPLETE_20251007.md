# ADR-TRINITY — Trinity Tier-1 Orchestration Complete

**Status:** Implemented • **Date:** 2025-10-07 • **Owner:** Codex Trinity Liaison (Sonnet 4.5)

## 1. Context

Jesse CEO initiated Trinity Team coordination with ChatGPT-5 "Commander" and "Marshall" joining Sonnet (Codex), Cheetah (Cursor), and Replit (Deployment) for LivHana E2E mission completion. The mandate was to achieve Tier-1 standards across voice-first cockpit, DeepSeek autonomy, compliance guardrails, and swarm orchestration.

## 2. Decision

Implemented complete Trinity Tier-1 orchestration with the following architecture:

### 2.1 Voice-Service + Reasoning-Gateway Integration

- **Redis Queue Architecture**: BullMQ for job processing with voice-mode-reasoning-jobs queue
- **ElevenLabs TTS Integration**: Proxy service with streaming support and voice management
- **DeepSeek Reasoning**: Anthropic + OpenAI fallbacks with cost tracking and swarm coordination
- **SSE Streaming**: Real-time progress updates via Server-Sent Events
- **JWT & Guardrails**: Security middleware with compliance validation

### 2.2 Unified Docker Stack

- **docker-compose.unified.yml**: Complete stack with voice-service, reasoning-gateway, vibe-cockpit, redis, nginx
- **1Password Integration**: Secure secret management via op CLI
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and service dependencies
- **Auto-scaling**: Memory limits, CPU allocation, and restart policies

### 2.3 Playwright MCP CI Pipeline

- **Deterministic Mocks**: VoiceServiceMock class for reliable E2E testing
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Complete CI/CD with lint, test, build, security scan, deploy
- **Compliance Testing**: Automated compliance validation in CI pipeline
- **Artifact Management**: Test reports, traces, and coverage uploads

### 2.4 Production Deployment Strategy

- **Cloud Run Services**: Containerized deployment with domain mappings
- **SSL Certificates**: Managed certificates for herbitrage.com and reggieanddroalice.com
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Health checks, uptime monitoring, and SLA enforcement
- **Rollback Capability**: Blue-green deployment with instant rollback

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Agentic Design Patterns

- **Prompt Chaining**: Voice → Reasoning → Response flow
- **Routing**: Intelligent model selection based on task type and budget
- **Memory**: Redis-backed session and context management
- **Reflection**: Job result validation and quality scoring
- **Swarm Orchestration**: Multi-agent coordination via reasoning-gateway

### 4.2 Negative

- **Increased Complexity**: Multiple services require coordination
- **Secret Management Dependency**: Requires 1Password CLI setup
- **Testing Overhead**: Mock maintenance for API contract changes

## 5. Monitoring & Success Metrics

### 5.1 Technical SLAs

- **Uptime**: 99.9% (8.76 hours downtime/year max)
- **API Response Time**: p95 < 200ms, p99 < 500ms
- **Queue Processing**: <30 seconds for reasoning jobs
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% for critical paths

### 5.2 Business KPIs

- **Voice Mode Adoption**: Target 80% of user interactions
- **Reasoning Quality**: 4.5+ star average rating
- **Compliance Score**: 100% pass rate
- **Cost Efficiency**: <$0.01 per reasoning request
