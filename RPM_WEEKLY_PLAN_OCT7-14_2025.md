## RISK MITIGATION

**Risk:** API keys not obtained ‚Üí Delivery can't launch
**Mitigation:** Jesse executes in next 10 minutes

**Risk:** DoorDash approval delayed ‚Üí Can't white-label
**Mitigation:** Use standard DoorDash Drive for now

**Risk:** Replit episode quality still low ‚Üí Content not usable
**Mitigation:** Claude Code takes over content generation

## DEPENDENCIES

1. YouTube Data API key ‚Üí YouTube analyzer
2. NewsAPI.org key ‚Üí Real-time news pipeline
3. DoorDash API key ‚Üí Delivery service launch
4. Uber API key ‚Üí Delivery service backup
