## USAGE SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Lost Laptop
**Situation**: Primary device stolen, need Liv Hana access immediately

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Obtain any computer with USB boot capability
2. Retrieve USB keychain from fireproof safe
3. Boot computer from USB (BIOS boot menu)
4. Enter USB encryption password (from memory or password card)
5. Insert YubiKey for 2FA authentication
6. Liv Hana boots with full conversation history

**Time to Access**: 5-10 minutes

---

### Scenario 2: Infrastructure Failure ("Atlas Meteor")
**Situation**: All cloud services down, internet disrupted, need offline AI

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Boot Liv Hana portable instance (USB)
2. System operates in offline mode:
   - Local models: Llama 3, CodeLlama (pre-downloaded)
   - No external API calls
   - Agent coordination via local Redis
3. Generate code, plans, documentation entirely offline
4. Export work to external storage when network restores

**Capabilities in Offline Mode**:
- ✅ Code generation (local models)
- ✅ Planning agents (RPM workflows)
- ✅ Document creation
- ❌ Voice mode (requires ElevenLabs API)
- ❌ Web research (requires internet)

---

### Scenario 3: EMP Event
**Situation**: Electromagnetic pulse destroys electronics, USB damaged

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Retrieve paper wallet from fireproof safe
2. Obtain new computer (post-EMP recovery)
3. Download Liv Hana bootstrap installer (from offline backup or community mirror)
4. Scan paper wallet QR codes to restore blockchain identity
5. System pulls agent state from IPFS (decentralized, EMP-proof)
6. Rebuild Liv Hana instance from blockchain-stored configuration

**Data Preserved**:
- ✅ Conversation history (IPFS)
- ✅ Agent configurations (blockchain)
- ✅ Credentials (paper wallet)
- ❌ Temporary files (lost)

---

## SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

### Three-Factor Authentication
1. **Physical Possession**: USB keychain + YubiKey
2. **Knowledge**: Memorized passphrase
3. **Biometric** (Optional): Fingerprint on YubiKey 5

### Encryption Layers
```
Layer 1: USB Disk Encryption (VeraCrypt)
         ├─ AES-256 full disk encryption
         └─ Password + keyfile (on YubiKey)

Layer 2: Credential Vault Encryption
         ├─ Salted SHA-512 hash
         └─ Separate passphrase from disk password

Layer 3: Blockchain Private Keys
         ├─ BIP39 mnemonic seed phrase
         └─ Hardware wallet signing (YubiKey)
```

### Threat Model Defenses

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| USB theft without password | Data encrypted, unreadable |
| Passphrase compromise without USB | Attacker has no encrypted data |
| YubiKey loss | Backup YubiKey exists in second safe |
| Paper wallet destruction | GPS-separated backup copy |
| Coercion (forced to decrypt) | Duress password wipes sensitive data |
| EMP (electronics destroyed) | Paper wallet + blockchain restore |
| Government seizure | Plausible deniability (hidden volumes) |

## BLOCKCHAIN IDENTITY SYSTEM

### Liv Hana Identity NFT
**Purpose**: Sovereign ownership of AI agent state

**Blockchain**: Ethereum L2 (Polygon or Arbitrum for low fees)

**Smart Contract**:
```solidity
// LivHanaIdentity.sol
contract LivHanaIdentity {
  struct AgentState {
    string ipfsHash;        // Pointer to agent memory on IPFS
    uint256 lastUpdated;    // Timestamp of last sync
    address owner;          // Sovereign user's wallet
  }

  mapping(address => AgentState) public identities;

  function updateAgentState(string memory _ipfsHash) public {
    require(identities[msg.sender].owner == msg.sender);
    identities[msg.sender].ipfsHash = _ipfsHash;
    identities[msg.sender].lastUpdated = block.timestamp;
  }
}
```

**How It Works**:
1. User's Ethereum address = Liv Hana identity
2. Agent state stored on IPFS (decentralized file storage)
3. IPFS hash recorded on blockchain (immutable, censorship-resistant)
4. Any device can restore agent state by querying blockchain + IPFS

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No central server (cannot be shut down)
- ✅ User owns their data (not a corporation)
- ✅ Survives infrastructure failures
- ✅ Portable across devices

## SETUP PROCEDURE

### Initial Kit Creation (One-Time)

**Step 1: Generate Master Identity**
```bash
# Generate blockchain wallet
npm run generate-wallet
# Output: Private key + paper wallet PDF

# Create USB encryption password (memorize this!)
PASSWORD="[your-secure-password]"
```

**Step 2: Prepare USB Keychain**
```bash
# Format USB (64GB+)
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX

# Mount encrypted volume
sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdX livhana

# Copy Liv Hana portable instance
rsync -av /path/to/LivHana-SoT/ /mnt/livhana/

# Embed YubiKey keyfile
ykman oath accounts add "LivHana-Emergency"
```

**Step 3: Print Paper Wallet**
```bash
# Generate QR codes
node scripts/generate-paper-wallet.js

# Print on waterproof paper (Rite in the Rain)
# Laminate with heat-seal laminator
# Store in fireproof safe (SentrySafe or equivalent)
```

**Step 4: Program YubiKey**
```bash
# Set FIDO2 PIN
ykman fido set-pin

# Add Liv Hana account
ykman oath accounts add "LivHana-Portable" --issuer "LivHana"

# Backup: Program second YubiKey identically
```

**Step 5: Test Recovery**
```bash
# Simulate device loss
# Boot from USB on different computer
# Verify all agents operational
# Confirm conversation history intact
```
