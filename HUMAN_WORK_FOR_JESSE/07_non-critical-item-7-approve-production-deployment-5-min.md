## NON-CRITICAL ITEM 7: APPROVE PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT (5 MIN)

**WHY:** Trinity needs authorization to deploy to Cloud Run
**IMPACT:** Without approval, services stay local only

**EXECUTE:**

Review services for deployment:
1. Delivery Service (backend/delivery-service) - Port 4003
2. HNC Content Engine (empire/content-engine) - Autonomous
3. Monitoring Dashboard (empire/content-engine/monitoring-dashboard.html) - Static

**APPROVE DEPLOYMENT:**
```bash
# If approved, run this command:
echo "APPROVED" > /Users/jesseniesen/LivHana-Trinity-Local/LivHana-SoT/DEPLOYMENT_APPROVED.txt

# Trinity will see this and execute deployments
```

**YOUR DECISION:**
- [ ] APPROVE - Deploy all services
- [ ] PARTIAL - Deploy only: _________________
- [ ] DEFER - Wait for testing

**TIME:** 5 minutes
**COMPLETE:** [ ]
