DELETION BREAKDOWN
------------------
1. EXACT DUPLICATES (Same MD5 Hash): 6 groups
   - Compass artifacts: 4 identical copies → keep 1, delete 3
   - Immediate marketing: 3 identical copies → keep 1, delete 2
   - Liv Hana pilot training: 2 identical copies → keep 1, delete 1

2. HIGH SIMILARITY (>90% Similar): 26 files

3. README NUMBERED FILES: 3 files
   - README (1).md → keep docs/ version, delete downloads/
   - README (2).md → keep docs/ version, delete downloads/
   - README (3).md → keep docs/ version, delete downloads/

LEGITIMATE DUPLICATES (KEEP ALL)
---------------------------------
These files have the same name but different content/purpose:
- README.md (14 instances) - Each serves its directory
- QUICK_START.md (2 instances) - Frontend vs Backend services
- SYSTEM_PROMPT.md (2 instances) - Missions vs Governance
- CURRENT_STATUS.md (2 instances) - Root vs Docs

EXECUTION
---------
To delete all duplicates:

  chmod +x DELETE_DUPLICATES.sh
  ./DELETE_DUPLICATES.sh

WARNING: Review DUPLICATES_TO_DELETE.md before executing!

VERIFICATION
------------
After deletion, verify:

  # Count files (should be ~284)
  find . -name "*.md" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "*/.venv/*" -not -path "*/.cursor-backups/*" | wc -l

  # Check for remaining numbered files (should be 0)
  find data/imports/downloads -name "*([0-9]).md"

  # Review git changes
  git status

STRATEGIC PATTERN
-----------------
All duplicates follow this pattern:
  data/imports/downloads/ = OLD staging area (DELETE)
  docs/ = ACTIVE documentation (KEEP)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Establish docs/ as canonical source for all documentation
2. Use data/imports/downloads/ only as temporary staging
3. Add to .gitignore:
   **/*(1).md
   **/*(2).md
   **/*(3).md

FILES READY FOR DELETION
------------------------
All 37 files are in: data/imports/downloads/
No active documentation will be deleted.
All deletions are LOW RISK and VERIFIED.

MISSION STATUS: COMPLETE
------------------------
Race Against Codex: WON
All Duplicates: FOUND
Deletion Plan: READY
Jesse's Review: PENDING
