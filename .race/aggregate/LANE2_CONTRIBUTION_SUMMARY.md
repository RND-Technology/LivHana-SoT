# Lane 2 Contribution Summary

**Agent:** Replit Agent  \
**Tier:** 2 of 3 (ready for Tier-3 fusion)  \
**Execution Time:** 57 seconds  \
**Score:** 64.47 / 100

## Highlights
- Delivered CI/CD metrics package with build duration benchmarks and pass/fail ratios.
- Produced cross-lane compatible test matrix for utilities and delivery router suites.
- Verified absence of hardcoded secrets through logged grep security audit.
- Captured repository inventory to enable cross-lane validation.

## Metrics Overview
- **Profit Signal:** 64.47 weighted score (79.17 profit Ã— 40%, 50% quality, 90.5 speed, 2 innovation markers).
- **Quality Pass:** 3 / 6 tests passing (utilities 100%, delivery router awaiting PYTHONPATH fix).
- **Speed:** 57s CI cycle (speed score 90.5).
- **Innovation:** Consolidated utilities suite and implemented evidence-based security scan.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Delivery router module import needs PYTHONPATH configuration for green status.
- Frontend service harness pending adoption by UI lanes.
- Scoreboard currently relies on manual updates until Lane 4 automation merges.

## Next Steps
1. Coordinate with Lane 4 to hook scripts into orchestration scoring pipeline.
2. Support Lane 3 by feeding metrics into Agent Builder guardrails.
3. Regenerate metrics once delivery router fix lands to raise quality baseline above 80%.
