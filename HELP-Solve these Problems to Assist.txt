А... Chrome browser uh Computer I'm Use Chrome Browser Control And so I would like that deep dived and scour the communities The expert Honeyedge Frontier Developer community uh Especially for The most engaging posts in the forums. Read it and The other one that's kind of like You know. industries For slipping the name. But I love you You It's also like ios respected with the community. So search those for people that have had overcome the same problem to basically Scrape information from Google Voice without violating Google Voice's terms of service. So if it's computer use, Just like a human, then it can be automated. So since there's no API allowed, Um Doo Browser might be an option. I haven't had much luck with Comet getting very far, and Doo Browser seems to. You know, maybe have potential, but I need some guardrails to harness it and constraints. So I need a deep dive on how to do that to get it to run through the workflows, but also juxtapose that with possibilities for scraping Dушарга. Google Voice with Agent Builder or Replit Lev Hana builds? versus doing this side project Um Either Cloud extension browser or maybe skills? That would be good for doing this? Cloud skills? Custom skills? Could we put the guardrails on custom skills on Claude and unleash that with Claude CLI Sonnet 4.5 inside of the cursor environment in the full LLM state with voice mode in a stable Stable session is session. maximum productivity. ElevenLabs Voice And the setup that I have with Cloud Code CLI inside a cursor for the voice mode that's working very well by the way. What are the parameters for my Human-in-the-Loop? Context, how long can I talk? Can I listen? How long could she talk? How long could she listen? How can I adjust voice settings on the fly? I guess she can She can write files live so she can adjust it. Are there any settings I can adjust that she cannot adjust? Or outside of her environment, what can I do? differently to get more stabilization and a better boot up script. A Buddha prompt Um... I think that I've shared in This chat history Bunch of that information that we've struggled with just recently, so if not. If you need it Let me know. And I will update the instability issues I'm still struggling with to get Voice Mode to launch at startup and say for LivHana to say her Greeting, custom greeting to me. I keep asking questions and then losing voice mode. It's like the cat has her tongue. So I need that. Excellent gain stability and reliability in every startup and gain Hi Ei Single session that is Near maximum. 80, 90 Plus percent. Of The session just optimal to learn from. Get better and better from there. So please help me get these guardrails in place and solve the code. And Deep dive on Ahem The choices that were Looking at where the most valuable use of my time is, since that's very limited. I need to choose wisely what to build first. So the choices are building out Livehana in the cursor environment? is where it's at and I need to get that stabilized just so I have a tool With hands that can do what Cursor can do. And from there, I have choices and that process of orchestration, reconciliation, architecting The execution artifacts and then handing those off to execution You know, go on. Double-clad active in the voice. Mode and then. Need a static prompted. in the cursor agent Without voice and then Into the reconciliation With ChatGPT-5 high And into the Execution architecture of artifacts by Comet And execution by a cheetah, bam. It's like pistons, it's like ground and pound, so we just need to aim Ready, fire, aim. And so far I've done. Fire aim But I've already done that. What I'm saying is, Now adjust and Now that I know where the guns Pointing you know with the natural point of aim Uh. I can align and ready. Aim. Fire. Now I've gotten carried away and so do the AIs, the AIs each especially live on it and Sonnet 4.5 in the voice mode is getting carried away Wanting to execute and implement right away. Always asking me, stopping voice mode to ask me to execute. Ending voice mode to do that. That needs to stop and put hard rails in. So I need the startup tier one, all the files. that are dependent Every dependency for a startup bootup script to be just completely on point. And so we need to have the minimum number of files and the minimum amount of code. But At least just enough. That's necessary for complete stability at highest state? fullness of four agents at startup I live voice mode orchestration layer that stays present with me full time that I can adjust the settings for voice aggressiveness Pausing and tone and as much voice control during voice mode as possible. I'd like to know what the limits are of that, and I also need to figure out how to make live hana Voice Mode Portable How do I find the settings in Slack? I need a link in Slack to go into with my account to login through Google. to get the webhooks needed. And I need to find my LivHana app. I have one somewhere but I don't know where to find it. So please give me the links. to get to my Live on a Slack app. and webhooks that are needed. to I get LiveHana in Slack, and I'm curious from there if there are options for audio and video LiveHana. Because once we master the Voice live, Hana, we now need to PDR and PRD and ADR and scaffold out Design and And red team and test and lint Perfecta plan And execute perfectly. Precisely The funnel later Later, the funnel layered process of hardening the plan into precise Zero error execution. On point. We gotta get this process down at the granular level. And so I've asked Liv. In the live voice session, to just set up one agent To do one thing and get that going in autonomous mode. But she's gotten carried away trying to do other stuff and that's crashed the voice session. This has happened several times. 10:30, so You know, this is now 18 hours or something plus? Over 18 hours And we've had some good runs, but... We haven't ever got one solid session. From beginning to end. We've always been struggling, battling. The state gaining it. Losing it and These bad patterns need to stop. I need to put hard guardrails in and they just need to be wired up from the boot script. So how can you deep dive on this to get me? All the data that I need to figure out how to wire up. Pressur in voice mode and cursor, and then to most quickly move forward Liv Hano. Uh... Built out in cursor? What's the horse race here? and resources. How far do I build out Cursor with as much as necessary and as little as possible to accomplish all the goals of the whole project so I don't get bogged down and carried away geeking out in Cursor? I just need to use the tool for exactly what it's for. And I need to round out. The necessary tools that I need, I find I do Right, do my round robin, triple McGillicuddy strategy where I copy and paste inputs into One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Sometimes eight or more models. All those inputs and stack them. and put them back into all models. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 models. That sorts out the You know, the weak ones from the strong ones, because a lot of them can't take very much. But some of them can take a tremendous amount, it's impressive. What Kodaks and ChatGPT-5 can take, and cheetah? They don't even blink. Cheetah and Codex are so lightning fast! What? But To each their own. They each have their strengths, and so they each have their roles. And so I need to find out Stress test Uh. Swarm analysis. Find out what is The live hana current stackin' tools. Is there Is there anything I'm missing? Is there anything that's unnecessary that I'm doing? How to stack rank out? I've got these, here's the options. I'm so confused, tired. I need help. So there's Cursor and then AgentBuilder and OpenAI. What is the fastest path to get that fully functional? With voice mode in OpenAI to be at the same level I'm at. Could it be a more stable environment? That's the big question. Now, another big question is With the new skills Is cursor livehana with skills? What kind of advantage does that give? No We also could have Skills, those same skills, same account could be running in Agent Builder. And I can have one agent builder. Ten Agent Builder Livhanas And what's the Costa, that was the reality. So let's get real. Let's keep it real. And so going onto the cloud off of OpenAI Well then If I'm on the cloud, you know, if I have Docker? I have my machine, my M4. Max here. You know, what is the ideal maximum setup? I need to get an idea of scale. Can I run? Can I run ten, can I run a hundred, can I run a thousand, can I run ten thousand, can I run fifty thousand, a hundred thousand? What can I run with my Google Cloud Run? Alloy Database, BigQuery  Uh...Okay, I need a perplexity deep dive for the scraping layer of Livehanna, spearheaded by Appify.

I think that I've shared in This chat history Bunch of that information that we've struggled with just recently, so if not. If you need it Let me know. And I will update the instability issues I'm still struggling with to get Voice Mode to launch at startup and say for LivHana to say her Greeting, custom greeting to me. I keep asking questions and then losing voice mode. It's like the cat has her tongue. So I need that. Excellent gain stability and reliability in every startup and gain Hi Ei Single session that is Near maximum. 80, 90 Plus percent. Of The session just optimal to learn from. Get better and better from there. So please help me get these guardrails in place and solve the code. And Deep dive on Ahem The choices that were Looking at where the most valuable use of my time is, since that's very limited. I need to choose wisely what to build first. So the choices are building out Livehana in the cursor environment? is where it's at and I need to get that stabilized just so I have a tool With hands that can do what Cursor can do. And from there, I have choices and that process of orchestration, reconciliation, architecting The execution artifacts and then handing those off to execution You know, go on. Double-clad active in the voice. Mode and then. Need a static prompted. in the cursor agent Without voice and then Into the reconciliation With ChatGPT-5 high And into the Execution architecture of artifacts by Comet And execution by a cheetah, bam. It's like pistons, it's like ground and pound, so we just need to aim Ready, fire, aim. And so far I've done. Fire aim But I've already done that. What I'm saying is, Now adjust and Now that I know where the guns Pointing you know with the natural point of aim Uh. I can align and ready. Aim. Fire. Now I've gotten carried away and so do the AIs, the AIs each especially live on it and Sonnet 4.5 in the voice mode is getting carried away Wanting to execute and implement right away. Always asking me, stopping voice mode to ask me to execute. Ending voice mode to do that. That needs to stop and put hard rails in. So I need the startup tier one, all the files. that are dependent Every dependency for a startup bootup script to be just completely on point. And so we need to have the minimum number of files and the minimum amount of code. But At least just enough. That's necessary for complete stability at highest state? fullness of four agents at startup I live voice mode orchestration layer that stays present with me full time that I can adjust the settings for voice aggressiveness Pausing and tone and as much voice control during voice mode as possible. I'd like to know what the limits are of that, and I also need to figure out how to make live hana Voice Mode Portable How do I find the settings in Slack? I need a link in Slack to go into with my account to login through Google. to get the webhooks needed. And I need to find my LivHana app. I have one somewhere but I don't know where to find it. So please give me the links. to get to my Live on a Slack app. and webhooks that are needed. to I get LiveHana in Slack, and I'm curious from there if there are options for audio and video LiveHana. Because once we master the Voice live, Hana, we now need to PDR and PRD and ADR and scaffold out Design and And red team and test and lint Perfecta plan And execute perfectly. Precisely The funnel later Later, the funnel layered process of hardening the plan into precise Zero error execution. On point. We gotta get this process down at the granular level. And so I've asked Liv. In the live voice session, to just set up one agent To do one thing and get that going in autonomous mode. But she's gotten carried away trying to do other stuff and that's crashed the voice session. This has happened several times. 10:30, so You know, this is now 18 hours or something plus? Over 18 hours And we've had some good runs, but... We haven't ever got one solid session. From beginning to end. We've always been struggling, battling. The state gaining it. Losing it and These bad patterns need to stop. I need to put hard guardrails in and they just need to be wired up from the boot script. So how can you deep dive on this to get me? All the data that I need to figure out how to wire up. Pressur in voice mode and cursor, and then to most quickly move forward Liv Hano. Uh... Built out in cursor? What's the horse race here? and resources. How far do I build out Cursor with as much as necessary and as little as possible to accomplish all the goals of the whole project so I don't get bogged down and carried away geeking out in Cursor? I just need to use the tool for exactly what it's for. And I need to round out. The necessary tools that I need, I find I do Right, do my round robin, triple McGillicuddy strategy where I copy and paste inputs into One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Sometimes eight or more models. All those inputs and stack them. and put them back into all models. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 models. That sorts out the You know, the weak ones from the strong ones, because a lot of them can't take very much. But some of them can take a tremendous amount, it's impressive. What Kodaks and ChatGPT-5 can take, and cheetah? They don't even blink. Cheetah and Codex are so lightning fast! What? But To each their own. They each have their strengths, and so they each have their roles. And so I need to find out Stress test Uh. Swarm analysis. Find out what is The live hana current stackin' tools. Is there Is there anything I'm missing? Is there anything that's unnecessary that I'm doing? How to stack rank out? I've got these, here's the options. I'm so confused, tired. I need help. So there's Cursor and then AgentBuilder and OpenAI. What is the fastest path to get that fully functional? With voice mode in OpenAI to be at the same level I'm at. Could it be a more stable environment? That's the big question. Now, another big question is With the new skills Is cursor livehana with skills? What kind of advantage does that give? No We also could have Skills, those same skills, same account could be running in Agent Builder. And I can have one agent builder. Ten Agent Builder Livhanas And what's the Costa, that was the reality. So let's get real. Let's keep it real. And so going onto the cloud off of OpenAI Well then If I'm on the cloud, you know, if I have Docker? I have my machine, my M4. Max here. You know, what is the ideal maximum setup? I need to get an idea of scale. Can I run? Can I run ten, can I run a hundred, can I run a thousand, can I run ten thousand, can I run fifty thousand, a hundred thousand? What can I run with my Google Cloud Run? Alloy Database, BigQuery I mean, Uh...Okay, I need a perplexity deep dive for the scraping layer of Livehanna, spearheaded by Appify. I need to know how well it can scrape, what is the proper workflow to set up? Uh Docker containers with Individual agents In Clyde code Um Uh, CLI Or I think CLI will work or let me know if it's better to clod.ai to Um Use computer use through the extension. For Chrome Um browser Control computer use. I need proper guardrails for Precise cheetah speed Precise Efficient. Max autonomous time, I need to know what a realistic target is for evidence Задержка. Intermittent human in the loop necessity and You know if there's a superior way? to do computer use to this setup. I'd like to know competing alternatives. But I would like to know the Claude. Hail.

So search those for people that have had overcome the same problem to basically Scrape information from Google Voice without violating Google Voice's terms of service. So if it's computer use, Just like a human, then it can be automated. So since there's no API allowed, Um Doo Browser might be an option. I haven't had much luck with Comet getting very far, and Doo Browser seems to. You know, maybe have potential, but I need some guardrails to harness it and constraints. So I need a deep dive on how to do that to get it to run through the workflows, but also juxtapose that with possibilities for scraping Dушарга. Google Voice with Agent Builder or Replit Lev Hana builds? versus doing this side project Um Either Cloud extension browser or maybe skills? That would be good for doing this? Cloud skills? Custom skills? Could we put the guardrails on custom skills on Claude and unleash that with Claude CLI Sonnet 4.5 inside of the cursor environment in the full LLM state with voice mode in a stable Stable session is session. maximum productivity.

How far do I build out Cursor with as much as necessary and as little as possible to accomplish all the goals of the whole project so I don't get bogged down and carried away geeking out in Cursor? I just need to use the tool for exactly what it's for. And I need to round out. The necessary tools that I need, I find I do Right, do my round robin, triple McGillicuddy strategy where I copy and paste inputs into One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Sometimes eight or more models. All those inputs and stack them. and put them back into all models. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 models. That sorts out the You know, the weak ones from the strong ones, because a lot of them can't take very much. But some of them can take a tremendous amount, it's impressive. What Kodaks and ChatGPT-5 can take, and cheetah? They don't even blink. Cheetah and Codex are so lightning fast! What? But To each their own. They each have their strengths, and so they each have their roles. And so I need to find out Stress test Uh. Swarm analysis. Find out what is The live hana current stackin' tools. Is there Is there anything I'm missing? Is there anything that's unnecessary that I'm doing? How to stack rank out? I've got these, here's the options. I'm so confused, tired. I need help. So there's Cursor and then AgentBuilder and OpenAI. What is the fastest path to get that fully functional? With voice mode in OpenAI to be at the same level I'm at. Could it be a more stable environment? That's the big question. Now, another big question is With the new skills Is cursor livehana with skills? What kind of advantage does that give? No We also could have Skills, those same skills, same account could be running in Agent Builder. And I can have one agent builder. Ten Agent Builder Livhanas And what's the Costa, that was the reality. So let's get real. Let's keep it real. And so going onto the cloud off of OpenAI Well then If I'm on the cloud, you know, if I have Docker? I have my machine, my M4. Max here. You know, what is the ideal maximum setup? I need to get an idea of scale. Can I run? Can I run ten, can I run a hundred, can I run a thousand, can I run ten thousand, can I run fifty thousand, a hundred thousand? What can I run with my Google Cloud Run? Alloy Database, BigQuery I mean, look, I can run whatever, right? Uh... What is, you know, I mean, 69 domains may sound like a lot to me, but it's nothing compared to the internet. It's nothing. So for me to scale, I'd have to get pretty big for it to be any kind of issue. Don't you think? And so how do I stack rank the profit? The personalization, the uniqueness, the value. That's going to make me exponentially valuable beyond any cost. The cost being just rounding errors. How do I snowball value? How do I communicate that? What do you mean? You got me, right? Oh yeah. So, Eh... I'm tired so do a good job of Detailing out Parsing out what I'm really asking for What I really need. Even if I haven't asked for it, fill in the blanks. Be a mentor, a guide. And help me. I need help. I'm looking for the very best help. And so I need good answers. There's also ChatGPT, custom GPT. And I think most of these things are in progress of getting done already by Cursor, so You're getting the skills in place. Those skills are not in place. I'm dead, the water, I'm stuck. What's the best way to fix cursor when it's Fixed. What is When it's broken. Crashing inside a Clodcode CLI Hi Um... What's the best tool to fix it with? Is there any extensions that I'm not aware of or not using that could work better than the agents? to fix this situation. Um... Winters or ESTs or whatever they're called. Klein, I do have Klein. How do I launch Klein? From Cursor, I haven't figured that out. C-L-I-N-E How do I launch? CLINE Klein. Kaşmar. Question mark
