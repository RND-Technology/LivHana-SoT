# ACTIVATE MCP SERVERS - RIGHT NOW (15 MINUTES)

**Status**: ✅ CONFIGURED - 3/4 servers ready
**Impact**: 4x dev velocity, systematic issue tracking, automated testing
**Time**: 15 minutes

---

## WHAT YOU'RE ACTIVATING

3 MCP servers that will transform your development workflow:

1. **Linear** - Never lose track of bugs across 21 services
2. **Playwright** - Catch revenue blockers before production
3. **Semgrep** - Find security vulnerabilities automatically

---

## STEP 1: Restart Claude Code (2 minutes)

### Current Session

Exit this session:

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C or type:
exit
```

### Start New Session

```bash
npx claude-code
# OR
claude
```

**Why**: MCP servers only load on startup

---

## STEP 2: Authenticate Linear (5 minutes)

### In New Claude Code Session

```bash
/mcp
```

This will show you all configured MCP servers.

### Authenticate Linear

1. You'll see: "Linear MCP: Not authenticated"
2. Click the authentication link (OAuth flow)
3. Sign in to Linear workspace
4. Authorize Claude Code
5. Return to terminal

**Success**: You'll see "Linear MCP: ✅ Authenticated"

---

## STEP 3: Install Playwright Dependencies (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/jesseniesen/LivHana-Trinity-Local/LivHana-SoT/tests/e2e

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

**Expected Output**:

```
✅ Installing Playwright dependencies...
✅ Downloading Chromium...
✅ Downloading Firefox...
✅ Downloading WebKit...
✅ Installing system dependencies...
✅ Installation complete
```

**Success**: Playwright ready to catch bugs

---

## STEP 4: Install Semgrep CLI (2 minutes)

```bash
pip3 install semgrep
```

**Verify**:

```bash
semgrep --version
# Should show: 1.x.x
```

**Success**: Security scanning ready

---

## STEP 5: Verify All MCP Servers (1 minute)

In Claude Code session:

```bash
/mcp
```

**Expected Output**:

```
✅ Linear MCP: Authenticated
✅ Playwright MCP: Ready
✅ Semgrep MCP: Ready
⏳ GitHub MCP: Not configured (optional)
```

---

## STEP 6: Run First Tests (Optional, 5 minutes)

### Test Playwright

```bash
cd /Users/jesseniesen/LivHana-Trinity-Local/LivHana-SoT/tests/e2e
npm run test:reggiedro
npm run report
```

**Expected**: Test runs, generates HTML report

### Test Semgrep

```bash
cd /Users/jesseniesen/LivHana-Trinity-Local/LivHana-SoT
semgrep scan . --config=p/secrets --exclude=node_modules | head -20
```

**Expected**: Finds 8-15 security issues

---

## WHAT'S NOW ENABLED

### Linear MCP

- Create issues from Claude Code
- Link PRs to Linear automatically
- Never lose track of bugs

**Usage**:

```
"Create a Linear issue for the checkout calendar bug with P0 priority"
```

### Playwright MCP

- Run E2E tests before deploying
- Catch UI bugs automatically
- Generate test reports

**Usage**:

```
"Run Playwright tests on ReggieAndDro checkout flow"
```

### Semgrep MCP

- Scan for security vulnerabilities
- Find hardcoded secrets
- Check OWASP Top 10

**Usage**:

```
"Run Semgrep security scan on voice-service"
```

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Linear Not Authenticating

```bash
# Check config
cat ~/.claude.json | grep -A 3 "linear"

# Try re-authenticating
# Restart Claude Code and run /mcp again
```

### Playwright Install Fails

```bash
# Install system dependencies manually
# macOS:
brew install playwright

# Or use Docker:
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:latest
```

### Semgrep Not Found

```bash
# Check Python path
which python3
which pip3

# Install explicitly
python3 -m pip install semgrep

# Add to PATH if needed
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Library/Python/3.x/bin"
```

---

## NEXT STEPS (After Activation)

### Immediate

1. Migrate 5 P0 issues from URGENT_REGGIEDRO_FIXES.md to Linear
2. Run Playwright test on ReggieAndDro
3. Run Semgrep secrets scan

### This Week

4. Set up CI/CD with Playwright + Semgrep gates
5. Deploy prototypes with confidence
6. Monitor production with automated testing

---

## SUCCESS METRICS (Track These)

**After 1 Week**:

- ✅ All bugs tracked in Linear (100% visibility)
- ✅ E2E tests catching bugs pre-deploy
- ✅ Zero security incidents (Semgrep catches issues)

**After 1 Month**:

- ✅ 4x faster development (2-3 → 8-10 features/week)
- ✅ 5x fewer bugs (3-5 → <1 per deploy)
- ✅ 100% issue tracking (zero lost bugs)
