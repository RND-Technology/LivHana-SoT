## Notes
**Customer Pain Point:**
- "I live 15 miles away, can you deliver?"
- "I can't drive, do you deliver?"
- "I need this tonight, how fast can you get it here?"

**Solution:**
Same-day delivery across entire SA metro (35-mile radius)

**Competitive Advantage:**
ONLY dispensary in SA offering real-time tracked delivery

**Revenue Model:**
- $10 delivery fee (<10 miles)
- $15 delivery fee (10-20 miles)
- $25 delivery fee (20-35 miles)
- Free delivery on orders >$150

**Margin:**
- DoorDash charges: $5-12 per delivery
- Net margin: $3-13 per delivery
- Volume target: 50-100 deliveries/day
- Net revenue: $150-1,300/day = $4,500-39,000/month
