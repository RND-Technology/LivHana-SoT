Endpoints:
GET  /api/revenue/current        - Current revenue metrics
GET  /api/revenue/trends         - Historical trends (7d, 30d, 90d)
GET  /api/revenue/products/top   - Top products by margin
GET  /api/revenue/customers/ltv  - Customer lifetime value
WS   /ws/revenue/live            - Live updates every 5 seconds

Tech Stack:

### PROJECT 2: SMART INVENTORY ALERTS (1.5 hours)

**Business Value**: $50K+/year (prevent stockouts, reduce overstock)

**What**: Automated alerts for inventory issues:

- Low stock warnings (before stockout)
- Overstock alerts (reduce waste)
- Trending products (order more)
- Slow movers (reduce inventory)
- Seasonal predictions

**Implementation**:

```
File: backend/analytics-service/src/inventory-alerts.ts

Features:
1. BigQuery ML for demand forecasting
2. Rule-based alerts (low stock, overstock)
3. Slack/email notifications
4. Historical trend analysis
5. Auto-reorder suggestions

Alerts:
- Low Stock: Product will run out in <7 days
- Overstock: Product turnover <30 days
- Trending: Sales up 50%+ week-over-week
- Slow Mover: No sales in 30+ days
- Seasonal: Predicted demand spike

Tech Stack:
- TypeScript strict mode
- BigQuery ML for forecasting
- Cloud Scheduler for daily runs
- Slack webhooks
- Email via SendGrid

### PROJECT 3: CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION ENGINE (1.5 hours)

**Business Value**: $40K+/year (targeted marketing, retention)

**What**: Automated customer segmentation for marketing:

- VIP customers (high LTV)
- At-risk customers (declining engagement)
- New customers (onboarding opportunities)
- Inactive customers (win-back campaigns)
- Product affinity groups

**Implementation**:

```
File: backend/analytics-service/src/customer-segments.ts

Features:
1. RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
2. K-means clustering (BigQuery ML)
3. Segment definitions + auto-tagging
4. Export to marketing tools
5. Segment performance tracking

Segments:
- VIP: Top 10% by LTV (high frequency + high value)
- At-Risk: Declining purchases (was active, now not)
- New: First purchase <30 days ago
- Inactive: No purchase in 90+ days
- Loyalists: 5+ purchases, consistent cadence

Tech Stack:
- TypeScript strict mode
- BigQuery ML for clustering
- Mailchimp/Klaviyo API integration
- CSV export for manual campaigns
- Cloud Run + Cloud Scheduler

Endpoints:
GET  /api/segments/list          - All segments with counts
GET  /api/segments/:id/customers - Customers in segment
POST /api/segments/refresh       - Recalculate segments
POST /api/segments/export        - Export to Mailchimp/CSV
```

**Success Criteria**:

### PROJECT 4: PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION API V2 (1 hour)

**Business Value**: $30K+/year (increased AOV, cross-sell)

**What**: Enhanced recommendations with more signals:

- Purchase history (existing)
- Content engagement (what they watch/read)
- Cart data (what they almost bought)
- Time-based patterns (time of day, day of week)
- Seasonal trends

**Implementation**:

```
File: backend/reasoning-gateway/src/si-recommendations-v2.ts

Enhancements over V1:
1. Multi-signal fusion (purchase + content + cart)
2. Time-based personalization (morning vs evening)
3. Seasonal boost (holiday products)
4. Cross-sell rules (bought X, likely want Y)
5. Confidence score improvements

New Signals:
- Content engagement (video views, article reads)
- Cart abandonment (products added but not purchased)
- Time patterns (purchases by hour/day)
- Seasonal trends (holiday, summer, etc.)
- Similar product views

Tech Stack:
- TypeScript strict mode
- BigQuery for multi-signal queries
- Redis caching (TTL 5 minutes)
- A/B testing framework
- Cloud Run deployment

Endpoints:
GET  /api/recommendations/v2/:customerId         - Enhanced recommendations
GET  /api/recommendations/v2/:customerId/explain - Why these recommendations?
POST /api/recommendations/v2/feedback            - Track conversion (bought or not)
GET  /api/recommendations/v2/performance         - A/B test results
```

**Success Criteria**:

- 20% better conversion than V1
- <500ms response time
- Explain feature working
- A/B test framework ready

**Value**: Increased AOV (15% lift) + cross-sell success (2x)
