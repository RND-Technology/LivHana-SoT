The research foundation is exceptional (1,188 lines of sourced intelligence), legal positioning is strong (political satire of public figure with verified facts), and strategic approach is sound (dog-whistle strategy balancing mainstream appeal with activist impact). Critical blocking issue is absence of actual lyrics for review - QA MUST approve draft lyrics before Suno generation. Platform compliance is solid with minor adjustments needed for Instagram. Cultural sensitivity approach is respectful and coalition-focused. All major factual claims are verified. Recommendation: PROCEED TO CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT with mandatory QA gates at lyrics review and video review before distribution. Risk level is acceptable for political satire campaign with proper execution."
