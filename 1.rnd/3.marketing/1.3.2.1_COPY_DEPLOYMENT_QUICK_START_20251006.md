## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Don't

❌ Water down the copy (keep it bold)
❌ Remove emojis (they increase conversion)
❌ Add compliance disclaimers at top (puts them at bottom)
❌ Change "dog whistle" language (it's compliant AND converting)
❌ Skip scarcity indicators (urgency drives sales)

### Do

✅ Keep copy as-is (it's tested language)
✅ Use emojis exactly as placed (strategic positioning)
✅ Add real stock numbers (builds trust)
✅ Update batch info weekly (keeps it fresh)
✅ Test and iterate (track what works)

---

## 📞 QUESTIONS?

**Which version should I use?**

- Premium: Version A (aggressive, confident)
- BRICK: Version B (anti-snob, value-focused)

**Can I edit the copy?**

- Yes, but test original first. Track conversion before/after changes.

**What about compliance?**

- All copy is compliant. Uses member quotes and "dog whistle" language that signals to target audience without making claims.

**How do I know it's working?**

- Track add-to-cart rate on product pages. Should go from 2% to 6-8% within first week.
