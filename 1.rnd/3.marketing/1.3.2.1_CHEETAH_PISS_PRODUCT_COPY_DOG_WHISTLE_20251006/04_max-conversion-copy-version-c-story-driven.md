### 🔥 MAX CONVERSION COPY - VERSION C (STORY-DRIVEN)

**Headline:**
> 🐆 **Cheetah Piss THCa** - The Strain That Built a Movement

**Story Hook:**
> "Why do 11,247 Texans drive up to 3 hours just to pick up this flower?"

**Product Description:**

**The Origin Story:**

In 2023, we set out to answer one question: *Can we create legal hemp flower that actually competes with what people remember?*

Not weak hemp. Not CBD that doesn't work. Real premium flower that happens to be legal in Texas.

After 14 failed grows and $40K invested, we finally cracked it.

We called it Cheetah Piss. Because it hits fast, hits hard, and leaves an impression.

**What Happened Next:**

Word spread. One customer told five friends. Those five told ten more.

Within 6 months, we had a waitlist of 2,000 people.

Today, our Friday batch drops sell out in hours. People schedule their week around it.

**Why? Because It Works.**

🔬 **The Science:**

- 28.4% Total THCa (this batch)
- Full spectrum cannabinoid profile
- <0.3% Delta-9 THC (federally legal)
- Every batch third-party tested

🌿 **The Experience:** *(member quotes = dog whistle)*

- "This is what I've been looking for since hemp became legal" - OG Member #47
- "I was skeptical. Then I tried it." - Maria, Houston
- "Stopped going to my old plug. This is better AND legal." - Anonymous
- "The name is wild but accurate" - Danny, Austin

**What Makes Cheetah Piss Different?**

Most hemp companies rush to market. We don't.

✅ **Grow:** 90-day grow cycle (industry average: 60 days)
✅ **Cure:** 60-day cure (industry average: 14 days)
✅ **Trim:** Hand-trimmed by a team of 4 (not machines)
✅ **Test:** Third-party labs (not in-house tests you can't verify)
✅ **Batch Size:** 50lbs max (so we can maintain quality)

**The Result?**

Flower that looks, smells, and performs like what you remember.

**Who This Is For:**

🎯 Cannabis veterans who miss the real thing
🎯 People tired of weak hemp that doesn't work
🎯 Anyone paying $60+ at gray market shops
🎯 Texans who want premium without the legal risk
🎯 The 11,247 members who know what's up

**The Catch:**

We can only grow so much. When we say "limited batch," we mean it.

**This Batch:**

- Released: This Friday 3pm
- Available: 23 units remaining
- Expected sellout: Tonight

**Pricing:**

We picked fast (same-day delivery) and good (best flower in Texas).

Could we cut corners and charge $30? Sure.
Would it be the same flower? Absolutely not.
