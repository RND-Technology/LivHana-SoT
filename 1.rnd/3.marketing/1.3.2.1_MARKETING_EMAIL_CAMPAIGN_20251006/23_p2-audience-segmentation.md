### **P2: Audience Segmentation**

1. Export customer list from Square
   - Past customers (purchased within 12 months)
   - Abandoned carts (added to cart, no purchase)
   - Email list (signed up, never purchased)
   - Re-engagement (purchased 12+ months ago)
2. Upload segments to SendGrid
3. Tag each segment for targeted sends
4. Set up suppression list (unsubscribes, bounces, complaints)

**Evidence:** Segment counts + upload confirmation in `.evidence/2025-10-03/email-segments/`
