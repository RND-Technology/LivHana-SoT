**Risk**: Large competitors have more data, more customers, more revenue to invest in AI

**Mitigation**:

- Liv Hana's AI is 2-3 years ahead
- First-mover advantage in sovereignty
- Can scale faster with AI automation
- Quality > quantity in early stages

### 2. **Capital**

**Dutchie Funding**: Likely $100M+ raised
**Liv Hana Funding**: Bootstrapped

**Risk**: Competitors can hire AI teams, buy startups, outspend

**Mitigation**:

- Liv Hana already built what they'd buy
- Speed + efficiency > large teams
- AI does the work of 10 engineers
- Cost advantage compounds over time

### 3. **Market Awareness**

**Dutchie/Leafly**: Known brands, thousands of dispensaries
**Liv Hana**: Unknown outside Texas

**Risk**: Nobody knows Liv Hana has superior AI

**Mitigation**:

- Focus on Texas first (local advantage)
- Word of mouth from performance
- AI gives competitive edge that sells itself
- Don't need everyone, need the right customers

### 4. **Platform Lock-In**

**Dutchie**: Integrated POS + e-commerce + payments + loyalty
**Liv Hana**: Need to integrate with LightSpeed, Square, etc.

**Risk**: Switching costs keep customers on Dutchie

**Mitigation**:

- Liv Hana integrates with existing systems
- Don't force platform change
- AI layer on top of current stack
- Autonomous operations as value-add
