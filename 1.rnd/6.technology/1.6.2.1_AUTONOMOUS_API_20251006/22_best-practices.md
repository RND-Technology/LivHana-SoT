## Best Practices

1. **Always use `requireApproval: true`** for production-affecting changes
2. **Monitor SSE streams** for real-time feedback during execution
3. **Review learnings regularly** to improve agent performance
4. **Test in development** before running autonomous tasks in production
5. **Keep rollback window short** - rollback immediately if issues detected
6. **Provide detailed context** in task descriptions for better results
7. **Set up alerts** for failed tasks
8. **Regular health checks** to monitor agent status
