## üéØ EXPECTED FINDINGS

### Most Likely Scenario:
**Account deactivated because**:
- Selling CBD products online
- VISA restrictions on hemp e-commerce
- Square's CBD program terminated or heavily restricted
- ReggiendDro products flagged as "ingestible hemp"

**Remedy**:
- Remove ALL CBD/hemp products from Square catalog
- Use Square ONLY for non-hemp products (accessories, merch)
- Find alternative payment processor for hemp:
  - Authorize.net (with hemp-friendly bank)
  - PayPal (limited CBD support)
  - Cryptocurrency
  - ACH/wire transfers
  - Alternative merchant account (higher fees)

**CBD Program Status**:
- Likely terminated or Texas not eligible
- Even if available, ingestible hemp probably excluded
- Seeds may be considered "agricultural products" (even more restricted)

**VISA Restrictions**:
- VISA did restrict hemp e-commerce 2023-2024
- In-person transactions may still work
- Topical CBD has less restrictions than ingestible
