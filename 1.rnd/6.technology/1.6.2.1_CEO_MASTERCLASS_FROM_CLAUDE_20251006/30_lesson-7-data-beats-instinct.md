### Lesson 7: Data Beats Instinct

**Every Decision Needs a Metric:**

| Decision | Metric to Track |
|----------|-----------------|
| Launch new product | Margin %, sales velocity |
| Hire employee | Revenue per employee |
| Open new location | Payback period (months) |
| Run marketing campaign | Customer acquisition cost (CAC) |
| Change pricing | Price elasticity, total revenue impact |

**Dashboard = Your Flight Instruments**

- Pilot doesn't "feel" altitude, reads gauge
- CEO doesn't "feel" revenue, reads dashboard

**Build the dashboard FIRST, make decisions SECOND.**
