### Lesson 3: Moats Win, Features Fade

**Your Moats (What Competitors Can't Copy):**

1. **Regulatory Licenses:** TX DSHS #690, CDFA PDP (2+ years to replicate)
2. **Political Capital:** Testified to TX legislature (trust + access)
3. **Customer Data:** 11,348 customers Ã— purchase history (proprietary intelligence)
4. **Domain Portfolio:** 69 domains (impossible to acquire now)
5. **AI Training Data:** Your Notion + Gmail = unique Liv Hana personality

**Features (Nice but Not Moats):**

- Voice AI (ElevenLabs anyone can use)
- Payment processing (KAJA available to all)
- Website design (easily copied)

**Focus 80% of energy on MOATS, 20% on features.**
