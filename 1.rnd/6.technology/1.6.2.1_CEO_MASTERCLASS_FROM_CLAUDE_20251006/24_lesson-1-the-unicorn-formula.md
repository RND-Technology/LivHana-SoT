### Lesson 1: The Unicorn Formula

**Unicorn = (Market Size × Your Share) × Margin × Scalability**

**Your Numbers:**

- **Market Size:** $7B Texas cannabis market (2025)
- **Your Share Target:** 5% = $350M annual revenue
- **Margin:** 60% gross margin (cannabis retail avg)
- **Scalability:** AI + automation = 10x without 10x employees

**Path to $1B Valuation:**

- **Revenue Multiple:** Cannabis tech trades at 10-15x revenue
- **Target Revenue:** $75M annual → $1B valuation (13x multiple)
- **Timeline:** 18 months (Q4 2025 → Q2 2027)

**How You Get There:**

```
Q4 2025: $1M monthly ($12M annual run rate)
Q1 2026: $3M monthly ($36M annual run rate) - Texas expansion
Q2 2026: $5M monthly ($60M annual run rate) - KAJA online national
