### Lesson 5: CEO Time is the Scarcest Resource

**Your Current Time Allocation (WRONG):**

- 40% - Tech/coding (you're building systems)
- 30% - Operations (store issues, inventory)
- 20% - Policy/compliance (testimony, Andrea Steel calls)
- 10% - Strategy (growth, fundraising)

**Unicorn CEO Time Allocation (RIGHT):**

- 50% - Strategy (what to build, where to expand)
- 30% - People (hire A-players, fire C-players)
- 15% - Capital (fundraising, investor relations)
- 5% - Everything else (delegate ruthlessly)

**Immediate Hires Needed:**

1. **COO** - Run operations, manage stores ($80K + equity)
2. **CTO** - Own tech stack, ship features ($120K + equity)
3. **CMO** - Growth, marketing, content ($100K + equity)
4. **CFO** (part-time) - Accounting, cash flow ($50K/year)

**Your New Job:** CEO = Chief Executive Officer, not Chief Everything Officer
