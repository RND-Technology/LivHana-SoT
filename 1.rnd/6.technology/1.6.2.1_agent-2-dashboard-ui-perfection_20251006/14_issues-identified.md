#### ISSUES IDENTIFIED

**P0 - Critical Issues:**

- **[Lines 200-211] Age gate can be bypassed**

  ```jsx
  <motion.button
    onClick={onVerify}  // ALLOWS INSTANT BYPASS
  ```

  - Date input validation exists but button bypasses it
  - Legal liability for cannabis/hemp sales
  - Fix: Require actual date validation before enabling button

  - No confirmation, animation, or state update visible to user
  - Cart updates but user doesn't know it worked

**P1 - Important Issues:**

- **[Lines 111-136] Demo products fallback always has fake data**
  - Better to show empty state than fake data
  - User can't tell real from mock

- **[Line 158] Header missing cart functionality**
  - Cart count shown but clicking "CHECKOUT" does nothing (line 260)
  - Broken user flow

- **[Lines 285-367] Product cards lack loading skeletons**
  - Content pops in without transition

**P2 - Enhancements:**

- **Image handling** - No lazy loading (line 302)
- **Accessibility** - Product cards need proper semantic HTML
- **Price display** - No tax calculation shown
- **Inventory indicator** - "50 LEFT" threshold arbitrary (line 295)
