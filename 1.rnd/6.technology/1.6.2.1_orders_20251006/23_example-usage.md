## Example Usage

```ts
const orderId = 'order_id6';

const body: UpdateOrderRequest = {
};

try {
  const { result, ...httpResponse } = await ordersApi.updateOrder(
  orderId,
  body
);
  // Get more response info...
  // const { statusCode, headers } = httpResponse;
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ApiError) {
    const errors = error.result;
    // const { statusCode, headers } = error;
  }
}
```

# Pay Order

Pay for an [order](../../doc/models/order.md) using one or more approved [payments](../../doc/models/payment.md)
or settle an order with a total of `0`.

The total of the `payment_ids` listed in the request must be equal to the order
total. Orders with a total amount of `0` can be marked as paid by specifying an empty
array of `payment_ids` in the request.

To be used with `PayOrder`, a payment must:

* Reference the order by specifying the `order_id` when [creating the payment](../../doc/api/payments.md#create-payment).
  Any approved payments that reference the same `order_id` not specified in the
  `payment_ids` is canceled.
* Be approved with [delayed capture](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments/card-payments/delayed-capture).
  Using a delayed capture payment with `PayOrder` completes the approved payment.

```ts
async payOrder(
  orderId: string,
  body: PayOrderRequest,
  requestOptions?: RequestOptions
): Promise<ApiResponse<PayOrderResponse>>
```
