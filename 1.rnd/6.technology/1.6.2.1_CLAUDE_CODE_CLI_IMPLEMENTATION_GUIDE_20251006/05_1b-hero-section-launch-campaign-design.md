### 1B: Hero Section + Launch Campaign Design

**Claude Code Prompt:**

```
You are creating a high-converting hero section for a cannabis e-commerce "Texas Takeover" launch campaign.

BRAND CONTEXT:
- Company: Reggie & Dro (Texas hemp flower retailer)
- Unique value prop: "Nobody else has brick weed" - $40/oz value option + premium strains
- Target audience: 30-60 year old Texans, conservative-leaning, cannabis-curious
- Campaign theme: Texas pride + legal freedom + quality range

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Hero image: Texas flag morphing into cannabis leaf (provide placeholder or Unsplash API)
- Headline: "TEXAS TAKEOVER IS HERE"
- Subheadline: "Legal Weed. Texas Pride. Brick Weed to Top Shelf."
- Countdown timer: JavaScript-based, resets every 7 days (creates perpetual urgency)
- CTA buttons: "Shop Brick Weed ($40/OZ)" | "Explore Top Shelf" | "Build Your Stash"
- Social proof: "★★★★★ 4.8/5 from 247+ Texas Customers"
- Trust badges: "Free Shipping Over $75 | Loyalty Points = Free Weed | Same-Day San Antonio"

TECHNICAL SPECS:
- Mobile-first responsive (breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
- Image optimization: WebP format with JPEG fallback
- Lazy loading: Below-the-fold content only
- Performance budget: Largest Contentful Paint <2.5s
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML5, ARIA labels, keyboard navigable

PLATFORM: LightSpeed webstore
- Integration method: Custom HTML/CSS injection via theme editor
- Existing theme: [provide theme name or "default LightSpeed theme"]
- Header file location: sections/header.liquid

DELIVERABLES:
1. hero-section.html (semantic markup)
2. hero-section.css (mobile-first, BEM methodology)
3. countdown-timer.js (vanilla JS, no dependencies)
4. Integration guide for LightSpeed
5. Performance optimization checklist

Create production-ready code with detailed comments. Ensure all assets are optimized and the section passes Google PageSpeed Insights with 90+ score.
```

**Expected Output:** Hero section code bundle + integration instructions
