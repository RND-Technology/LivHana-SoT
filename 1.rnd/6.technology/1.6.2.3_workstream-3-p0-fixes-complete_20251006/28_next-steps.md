## Next Steps

1. **Start all services** and run full E2E test suite:

   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:critical
   ```

2. **Performance testing** - verify all changes don't impact load times

3. **Security penetration testing** - attempt to bypass age gate and auth

4. **Load testing** - ensure graceful degradation works under load

5. **Monitoring setup** - connect error logging to external service
