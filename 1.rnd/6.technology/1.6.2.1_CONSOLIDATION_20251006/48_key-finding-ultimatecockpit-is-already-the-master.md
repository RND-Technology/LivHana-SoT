### Key Finding: UltimateCockpit is Already the Master

The current architecture is actually GOOD:

- `UltimateCockpit` is a unified dashboard hub (679 lines)
- It IMPORTS all other dashboards as sub-components (lines 50-54)
- Each dashboard has distinct functionality (not true duplicates)
- The pattern is container/presentational - **architecturally sound**

**The Problem Isn't Architecture - It's Data Fetching**
