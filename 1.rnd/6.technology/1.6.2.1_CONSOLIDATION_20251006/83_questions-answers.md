## QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: Will this break anything?**
A: No. Zero breaking changes. All features remain functional.

**Q: Do we lose any functionality?**
A: No. We only delete stub components that return "coming soon". All working features stay.

**Q: Why not delete the duplicate dashboards?**
A: They're not duplicates - they're sub-dashboards with distinct UIs. UltimateCockpit orchestrates them. The architecture is correct.

**Q: What's the biggest win?**
A: Unified API client (400 lines reduced) + lifted data fetching (3x calls â†’ 1x) = 38% bundle reduction.

**Q: Can we do this incrementally?**
A: Yes. Each phase is independent:

  1. Delete stubs (30 min)
  2. Unify API (2 days)
  3. Lift data (5 days)
  4. Centralize styles (2 days)

**Q: What if something breaks?**
A: Git revert. Rollback plan included in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md.
