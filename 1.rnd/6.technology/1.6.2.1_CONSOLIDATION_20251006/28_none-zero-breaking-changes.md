### NONE - Zero Breaking Changes

**Why?**

1. Stub components return empty UI - deleting them is invisible to users
2. API consolidation is internal refactor - same endpoints, same responses
3. Dashboard refactor maintains same UI - just lifts data fetching
4. Style consolidation is visual no-op - same appearance
5. All routes stay functional (except 3 stub routes nobody uses)

**Migration Required:** ZERO
**User Impact:** ZERO (faster loads only)
**API Changes:** ZERO
