### 4. **Platform Lock-In**

**Dutchie**: Integrated POS + e-commerce + payments + loyalty
**Liv Hana**: Need to integrate with LightSpeed, Square, etc.

**Risk**: Switching costs keep customers on Dutchie

**Mitigation**:

- Liv Hana integrates with existing systems
- Don't force platform change
- AI layer on top of current stack
- Autonomous operations as value-add
