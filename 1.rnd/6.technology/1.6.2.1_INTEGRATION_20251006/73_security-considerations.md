### Security Considerations

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| API keys in .env | ✅ Secure | Not committed to git, stored locally |
| CORS configuration | ✅ Configured | Only localhost allowed in dev |
| Authentication | ⚠️ Disabled in dev | Enabled in production via `NODE_ENV=production` |
| Rate limiting | ✅ Active | Redis-backed rate limiter |
| SQL injection | ✅ Protected | Parameterized queries, BigQuery client escaping |
| Data encryption | ✅ Yes | HTTPS for all external APIs, BigQuery at-rest encryption |
