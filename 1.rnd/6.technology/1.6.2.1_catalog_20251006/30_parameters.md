|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `objectId` | `string` | Template, Required | The object ID of any type of catalog objects to be retrieved. |
| `includeRelatedObjects` | `boolean \| undefined` | Query, Optional | If `true`, the response will include additional objects that are related to the<br>requested objects. Related objects are defined as any objects referenced by ID by the results in the `objects` field<br>of the response. These objects are put in the `related_objects` field. Setting this to `true` is<br>helpful when the objects are needed for immediate display to a user.<br>This process only goes one level deep. Objects referenced by the related objects will not be included. For example,<br><br>if the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItem, its associated<br>CatalogCategory objects, CatalogTax objects, CatalogImage objects and<br>CatalogModifierLists will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the<br>response. If the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItemVariation,<br>its parent CatalogItem will be returned in the `related_objects` field of<br>the response.<br><br>Default value: `false`<br>__Default__: `false` |
| `catalogVersion` | `bigint \| undefined` | Query, Optional | Requests objects as of a specific version of the catalog. This allows you to retrieve historical<br>versions of objects. The value to retrieve a specific version of an object can be found<br>in the version field of [CatalogObject](../../doc/models/catalog-object.md)s. If not included, results will<br>be from the current version of the catalog. |
| `includeCategoryPathToRoot` | `boolean \| undefined` | Query, Optional | Specifies whether or not to include the `path_to_root` list for each returned category instance. The `path_to_root` list consists<br>of `CategoryPathToRootNode` objects and specifies the path that starts with the immediate parent category of the returned category<br>and ends with its root category. If the returned category is a top-level category, the `path_to_root` list is empty and is not returned<br>in the response payload.<br>__Default__: `false` |
| `requestOptions` | `RequestOptions \| undefined` | Optional | Pass additional request options. |
