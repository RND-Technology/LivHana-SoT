#### Optimization Recommendations

**QUICK WIN #1: Push filtering to BigQuery**

```javascript
// Optimize fetchDashboardData() - Line 69
SELECT
  id, amount, currency, status, customer_id, created_at,
  DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), created_at, DAY) as days_ago
FROM `${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET}.${PAYMENTS_TABLE}`
WHERE DATE(created_at) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 180 DAY)
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1000
```

**QUICK WIN #2: Partitioned aggregation**

```javascript
// Replace client-side sumByFilter (lines 93-96)
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
      THEN amount ELSE 0 END) / 100 as today_revenue,
  SUM(CASE WHEN created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
      THEN amount ELSE 0 END) / 100 as week_revenue,
  SUM(CASE WHEN created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
      THEN amount ELSE 0 END) / 100 as month_revenue,
  SUM(amount) / 100 as year_revenue,
  COUNT(*) as total_transactions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as total_customers
FROM `${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET}.${PAYMENTS_TABLE}`
WHERE DATE(created_at) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 180 DAY)
```

**Cost Savings**: 60-80% reduction in data processed
**Performance Gain**: 200-400ms vs 2-5s
