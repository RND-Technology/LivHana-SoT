### Current State: 7.5/10 Production Readiness

**Strengths:**

- Solid microservices foundation
- Modern tech stack (Node 20, Redis 7, BigQuery)
- Queue-based async processing
- Compliance-ready data retention

**Critical Path to Production:**

1. Fix BigQuery query performance (2-5s → 200ms)
2. Enable horizontal scaling (Redis-backed cache)
3. Reduce frontend bundle size (2MB → 800KB)
4. Add production-grade monitoring

**Texas Scale Readiness:**

- With Phase 1 fixes: Ready for 50K members
- With Phase 2 deployment: Ready for 100K members
- With Phase 3 optimization: Ready for 200K+ members

**Cost Efficiency:**

- Current optimizations: 60% BigQuery cost reduction
- Infrastructure at scale: 0.6-0.8% of revenue (healthy margin)

**Recommendation**: Execute Quick Wins (#1-5) immediately. System is architecturally sound but needs production hardening.
