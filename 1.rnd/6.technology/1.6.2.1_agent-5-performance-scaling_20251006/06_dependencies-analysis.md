### Dependencies Analysis

**Core Stack:**

- Node.js 18-20 (mixed versions across services)
- Express 4.x (mature, battle-tested)
- Redis 4.7.x (modern, supports streams)
- BullMQ 5.12.x (latest generation queue)
- BigQuery SDK 7.9.x (latest)
- Pino logging (high performance)

**Concern**: Mixed Node versions (18 vs 20) - standardize to Node 20 LTS
