### Current Architecture Health: 7.5/10

**Strengths:**

- Microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Redis-backed queue system (BullMQ) for async processing
- BigQuery integration with caching layer (30s TTL)
- Docker containerization for all services
- Helmet security middleware enabled
- Rate limiting configured but not consistently applied

**Critical Bottlenecks Identified:**

1. **BigQuery query performance** - Full table scans on 180-day windows
2. **Frontend bundle size** - 603MB node_modules (no build optimization visible)
3. **Missing Redis connection pooling** - Single connection per service
4. **No CDN strategy** - Static assets served from origin
5. **Inconsistent caching** - Some services lack cache layers
6. **No horizontal scaling readiness** - Stateful sessions
