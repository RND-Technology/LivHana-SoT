### **Gaps (Need More Info):**

1. **Current revenue sources:** Where is the $34K/day coming from? Reggie & Dro? Square transactions? Break it down.
2. **Team:** Are you solo or do you have staff? Who handles operations, sales, support?
3. **Time availability:** How many hours/week can you dedicate to growth?
4. **Risk tolerance:** Are you willing to invest $5K-$10K in marketing to scale faster?
5. **Exit strategy:** Build to sell? Build to hold? Build to franchise?
