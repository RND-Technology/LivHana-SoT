### WEEK 2 (Days 11-17): OPTIMIZE

**Focus:** Double down on what worked Week 1

- [ ] Analyze Week 1 data deeply (which products, sources, messages worked?)
- [ ] Increase budget on winning ad campaigns (2x spend if ROAS >3)
- [ ] Launch retargeting for abandoned carts (10% discount code)
- [ ] Re-engage past customers who didn't buy in Week 1 (special offer)
- [ ] Start review collection push (email all customers who received orders)
- [ ] Test subscription waitlist campaign (gauge interest, build list)

**Week 2 Targets:**

- Orders: 200-250 (cumulative 375-450)
- Revenue: $15,000-18,750 (cumulative $28,125-33,750)
- Repeat purchase rate: 10-15%
