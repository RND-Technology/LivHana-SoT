## 2.0.0 / 2015-02-09

Unfortunately with 1.10.0 - compatibility broke with older versions because of
the `addChainableNoop`. This change has been reverted.

Any plugins using `addChainableNoop` should cease to do so.

Any developers wishing for this behaviour can use [dirty-chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dirty-chai)
