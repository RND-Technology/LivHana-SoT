### Official Bower Support

Support has been added for the Bower Package Manager ([bower.io])(<http://bower.io/>). Though
Chai could be installed via Bower in the past, this update adds official support via the `bower.json`
specification file.

* [#175](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/175) Add `bower.json`.
