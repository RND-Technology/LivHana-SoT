### Coverage Reporting

Coverage reporting has always been available for core-developers but the data has never been published
for our end users. In our ongoing effort to improve accountability this data will now be published via
the [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/) service. A badge has been added to the README and the full report
can be viewed online at the [chai coveralls project](https://coveralls.io/r/chaijs/chai). Furthermore, PRs
will receive automated messages indicating how their PR impacts test coverage. This service is tied to TravisCI.
