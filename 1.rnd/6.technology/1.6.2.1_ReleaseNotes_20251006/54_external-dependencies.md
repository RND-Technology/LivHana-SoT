#### External Dependencies

This is the first non-developement dependency for Chai. As Chai continues to evolve we will begin adding
more; the next will likely be improved type detection and deep equality. With Chai's userbase continually growing
there is an higher need for accountability and documentation. External dependencies will allow us to iterate and
test on features independent from our interfaces.

Note: The browser packaged version `chai.js` will ALWAYS contain all dependencies needed to run Chai.
