### CI and Browser Testing

Chai now runs the browser CI suite using [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) directed at
[SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/). This means we get to know where our browser support stands...
and we get a cool badge:

[![Selenium Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/logicalparadox.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/logicalparadox)

Look for the list of browsers/versions to expand over the coming releases.
