# TPOP Master Class — Target Population of One

**Version:** 1.0 • **Date:** 2025-09-10 • **Owner:** Liv Hana (AI EA) → Jesse Niesen  
**Scope:** High Noon Cartoon (HNC), One Plant Solution (OPS), Reggie & Dro (R&D), Herbitrage cockpit  
**Guardrails:** 21+ only • No medical claims • Natural cannabinoids only; validated NIST methods • Satire allowed for public figures • Brands are **not** characters

---

## What “TPOP” Means (and why we use it)

**TPOP = Target Population of One.**  
Design every message for one **singular, crystal‑clear persona** so it lands with surgical precision. You can (and should) maintain **multiple TPOPs**, but each asset speaks to *one* at a time. This is the antidote to generic “everyone” marketing and to muddled policy messaging.

TPOP also reads well as **Top‑Priority Outreach Populations**—i.e., the small set of micro‑audiences that deserve dedicated assets and funnels.

### Core principles

1. **Speak to one to reach many.** Specific ≫ generic.  
2. **Beliefs drive behavior.** Map beliefs before features/benefits. (Worldview → Trigger → Action.)  
3. **Safety + Prosperity + Truth.** Every TPOP frame should show *family safety, honest stewardship, jobs/tax math, and factual clarity*.  
4. **Compliance is non‑negotiable.** 21+ age‑gate, no medical claims, NIST‑validated standards only.  
5. **Single SoT, many channels.** One canonical TPOP record → orchestrate creative and policy/commerce variants per channel.

## The TPOP Record (canonical YAML)

Paste this into Claude “Additional Text Context” or your cockpit; one file **per** TPOP.

```yaml
tpop:
  id: "tpop-texas-001"
  label: "Veteran Small-Biz Dad (TX)"
  owner: "OPS/HNC"
  goal: "Convert to subscriber + OPS petition + R&D membership"
  belief_map:
    core_values: ["Faith", "Family safety", "Service", "Rule of law", "Jobs & small business", "Freedom from DC overreach"]
    objections: ["Is this safe for kids?", "Is this legal?", "I don’t want stoner culture.", "Cartel risk / enforcement"]
    proofs:
      safety: ["21+ biometric ID", "Child-resistant packaging", "Validated NIST methods", "Texas enforcement plan"]
      prosperity: ["Texas jobs & local retailers", "Tax leakage if banned", "HNC → OPS → R&D flywheel"]
    moral_frame: "Honest stewardship of families & freedom; punish bad actors, not responsible Texans."
  jobs_to_be_done:
    - "Protect my family and uphold the law"
    - "Support veteran- and Texas-owned businesses"
    - "Back leaders who tell the truth and deliver outcomes"
  anti_triggers: ["Medical cure claims", "Youth-friendly visuals", "Partisan sneers", "Pot-leaf spam"]
  dog_whistles: ["Serve & protect", "Raise ‘em right", "Work hard, keep what you earn", "Semper Fi nod"]
  channels: ["YouTube longform", "Facebook Groups", "Talk radio clips", "Email"]
  content_hooks:
    hook_lines: [
      "Protect Texas families without banning the truth.",
      "Freedom with standards: age-gate, CR packs, real enforcement."
    ]
    running_jokes: ["'puff-ickly' wordplay (once)", "Stay TOONED"]
    easter_eggs: ["R&D lapel pin", "Semper Fi watch-etch", "Make America Grow Again"]
  offers_and_cta:
    path: ["Watch HNC → Subscribe", "Join OPS list → petition", "R&D membership → Blue Dream raffle"]
    disclaimers: "21+ only. No medical claims. Natural cannabinoids; NIST-validated methods."
  metrics:
    north_star: "Watch time → Petition sign → R&D membership"
    kpis: ["Avg view duration", "CTR to OPS", "Petition submits", "Membership joins"]
  compliance_check:
    age_gate: true
    cr_packaging: true
    satire_brand_separation: true
    nist_only: true
```

> **Tip:** Maintain **3–6 active TPOP records** at a time. Rotate content creation by TPOP each week to keep resonance high and metrics clean.

## Rapid TPOP Workshop (20 minutes → ready to ship)

**Step 1 — Name the worldview (4 minutes)**  

- What must be *true* for them to nod along? List **5 beliefs** they hold.  
- Which **pain** keeps them from acting? (safety, legality, reputation, money)  
- Which **gain** they care about? (family, jobs, pride, clarity)

**Step 2 — Write the *Safety–Prosperity–Truth* proof stack (6 minutes)**  

- Safety: “21+ biometric ID,” “CR packages,” “validated NIST methods,” “Texas enforcement plan.”  
- Prosperity: “Texas leads legal commerce,” “jobs & tax math,” “don’t off-shore the market to cartels/prohibition.”  
- Truth: “De‑schedule Cannabis sativa L; end hemp/marijuana split; codify standards not bans.”

**Step 3 — Hook + CTA ladder (6 minutes)**  

- Hook = belief mirror + single myth bust.  
- CTA ladder = *watch → subscribe → OPS action → R&D membership*.  
- Add **one** dog‑whistle and **one** Easter egg; avoid anti‑triggers.

**Step 4 — Guardrails pass (4 minutes)**  

- 21+ line repeated every ~20s for social edits.  
- No medical claims.  
- Brands ≠ characters; satire only for public figures.  
- NIST‑only novel cannabinoids.

## Prompts (drop‑in)

**Claude “Additional Text Context” append:**

```
You know the TPOP framework: Target Population of One.
- Always write to ONE TPOP at a time.
- Use the Safety–Prosperity–Truth proof stack.
- Enforce guardrails: 21+, no medical claims, brands are not characters, NIST-only novel cannabinoids.
- Output: Hook (1 line) → 60–120s script → Lower-thirds (3) → CTA ladder (3 steps) → Compliance footer.
```

**Task prompt (script gen):**

```
Act as Liv Hana. Write a 75s HNC segment for TPOP=<ID>. Mirror their beliefs, bust one myth, show Safety–Prosperity–Truth. Include 1 dog-whistle and 1 Easter egg from the TPOP record. End with Subscribe → OPS → R&D. Return JSON: {{title, hook, script, lowerThirds, cta, compliance}}.
```

## Data Model (AlloyDB) – minimal tables

```sql
create table if not exists tpop (
  id text primary key,
  label text not null,
  owner text,
  record jsonb not null, -- entire YAML as JSON
  active boolean default true,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table if not exists tpop_metrics_daily (
  tpop_id text references tpop(id),
  date date not null,
  views bigint default 0,
  avg_view_duration_seconds int default 0,
  ops_cta_clicks int default 0,
  ops_signups int default 0,
  rd_memberships int default 0,
  primary key (tpop_id, date)
);
```

---

## A/B Grid (what to test first)

- **Hook phrasing:** “Freedom with standards” vs “Protect families without bans.”  
- **Visual background:** Capitol silhouette vs storefront safe‑pack demo.  
- **CTA order:** OPS → R&D vs R&D → OPS.  
- **Voice:** Conversational vs narrator; speed 0.92x vs 1.0x.

---

## 5‑Minute Quickstart

1. Pick **one** TPOP above; copy the YAML; adjust beliefs & dog‑whistles.  
2. Run the **Task prompt** with that TPOP → get JSON script.  
3. Render in **Synthesia** (avatar + 0.92x voice).  
4. Publish to **YouTube** with tag set: “Texas”, “THC”, “Wall of Weed”, “Stay TOONED”.  
5. Track KPIs in cockpit; iterate tomorrow.

---

## Glossary

- **TPOP:** Target Population of One (or Top‑Priority Outreach Population instance).  
- **Dog‑whistle:** A subtle, respectful signal recognized by the TPOP.  
- **Easter egg:** A tiny visual/text payoff that rewards attention.  
- **Proof stack:** Safety → Prosperity → Truth; the HNC/OPS/R&D “triangle of persuasion.”
