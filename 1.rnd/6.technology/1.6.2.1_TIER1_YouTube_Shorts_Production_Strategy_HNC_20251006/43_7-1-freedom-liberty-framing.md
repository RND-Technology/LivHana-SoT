### 7.1 Freedom/Liberty Framing

**Pattern**: Position cannabis as ultimate freedom issue

**Texas Angle**:

- Gadsden Flag imagery ("Don't Tread on Me")
- 10th Amendment sovereignty
- State rights over federal tyranny
- "Who decides what we can and can't ingest in our own homes?"

**Rally Cry Integration**:

- "Grow baby grow" = economic freedom
- "Sell baby sell" = free market principles
- "Heal" = compassionate conservatism
