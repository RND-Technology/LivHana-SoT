### 6.1 Comment-Baiting Techniques (Policy-Compliant)

**YouTube penalizes artificial engagement** ("Comment if you agree!"), but **rewards genuine engagement prompts**:

**Legitimate Comment Triggers**:

1. **Open-Ended Questions**: "What would YOU do with $6 billion in tax revenue?"
2. **Opinion Requests**: "Best cannabis policy: Colorado or Oklahoma?"
3. **Personal Stories**: "Know someone who needs medical cannabis? Share below."
4. **Controversial Statements**: "Some say Texas isn't ready. Prove them wrong."
5. **Fill in Blank**: "Cannabis prohibition is _____ for Texas."
6. **Prediction Requests**: "When will Texas legalize? Drop your guess."
7. **Regional Rivalry**: "Texas vs. Oklahoma: Who wins on freedom?"
8. **Mistake Correction**: Intentional error for community correction
