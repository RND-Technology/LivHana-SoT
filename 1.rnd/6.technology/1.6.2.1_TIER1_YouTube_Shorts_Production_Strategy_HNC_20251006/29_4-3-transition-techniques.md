### 4.3 Transition Techniques

**Fast-paced editing maintains attention** (Shorts audiences expect cuts every 2-4 seconds):

1. **Hard Cuts**: Standard fact delivery (every 3-5 seconds)
2. **Swipe Transitions**: Vertical swipe mimics scroll action (native feel)
3. **Zoom Emphasis**: Sudden 120% zoom on key statistics
4. **Match Cuts**: Visual continuity between concepts (map â†’ chart)
5. **Text Wipes**: New text "wipes" old text (efficient information transfer)

**Animation-Specific Advantage**:
Create impossible transitions live-action can't achieve:

- Character transforming into data visualization
- Wall of Weed growing in time-lapse
- Texas map morphing into economic charts
- Money flowing from Big Pharma to politicians
