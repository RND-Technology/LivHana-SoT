### 4.1 Shot Composition Strategy

**Rule of Thirds for Character Placement**:

- Characters in left/right thirds for text overlay space
- Center composition for emotional impact moments
- Dynamic angles: Slight tilt adds energy without disorienting

**Text Overlay Strategy** (Critical for Retention):

| Element | Specification | Rationale |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Font** | Bold sans-serif (Arial Black, Impact, Bebas Neue) | Mobile readability |
| **Size** | Minimum 80pt | Visible on small screens |
| **Placement** | Lower/upper third (never center) | Don't cover faces |
| **Timing** | 0.5-1 sec ahead of voiceover | Pre-reading boosts retention |
| **Color** | White text + black outline | High contrast any background |
| **Animation** | Scale 0â†’100% in 0.2 sec | Subtle pop-in effect |
| **Word Count** | 5-7 words maximum per frame | Instant comprehension |

**Text Overlay Hierarchy**:

1. **Hook text** (0-3 sec): Largest, brightest, center-upper
2. **Supporting facts** (4-30 sec): Lower third, smaller but readable
3. **Call-to-action** (45-60 sec): Return to large, bright, upper positioning
