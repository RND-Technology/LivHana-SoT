3. "This Texas veteran earned his freedom. Now politicians deny his medicine."
4. "Texas farmers could make $6 billion. Politicians say no."
5. "38 states figured it out. Why not Texas?"
6. "Don't Mess with Texas—except Big Pharma already did."
7. "Texas: Land of personal freedom. Except when it comes to your medicine."
