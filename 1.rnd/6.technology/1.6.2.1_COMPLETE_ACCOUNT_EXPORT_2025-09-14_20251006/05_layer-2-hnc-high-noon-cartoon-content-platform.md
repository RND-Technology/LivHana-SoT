**Distribution Strategy:**

**Predictive Engine Architecture:**
Jesse requested development of "the world's best predictive engine" using satirical cartoon characters to make accurate political predictions, particularly around Texas cannabis policy, federal rescheduling, and Trump administration moves. The strategy involves building audience trust through accurate predictions delivered via cartoon storylines.

Long-term vision includes scalable app where users select character avatars (Captain America, Major Funny, Captain Cannabis) as personal AI assistants, creating recurring subscription revenue beyond content consumption.
