### Agent #5: Performance & Scaling

**Report:** `reports/agent-5-performance-scaling.md` (TIER 1 COMPLETE)

**Key Findings:**

- **System Health: 7.5/10** - Production-ready with critical optimizations needed
- 5 critical bottlenecks identified with specific fixes

**Critical Bottlenecks:**

1. BigQuery full table scans → 80% latency reduction possible (8 hours)
2. Frontend bundle size → 60% reduction possible (4 hours)
3. In-memory cache → Blocks horizontal scaling (6 hours to fix)
4. Sync job blocking → 5-min event loop blocks (2 hours to fix)
5. No table partitioning → 10x cost reduction at scale (4 hours)

**Quick Wins (24 hours total):**

- Execute 5 fixes → Ready for 50K concurrent users
- BigQuery optimization → 80% faster, 60% cheaper
- Code splitting → 1-2s load time (from 3-5s)
- Redis cache → Horizontal scaling enabled
- Async sync jobs → 100+ req/s capacity

**Cost Projections:**

- Current (11K members): $230-280/month
- Year 1 TX (50K members): $940-1,140/month (0.64% of revenue)
- Year 3 TX (200K members): $4.5K-5.5K/month (0.62% of revenue)

**Architecture Ready for:**

- 50K concurrent users (Year 1)
- 99.9% uptime
- Multi-region deployment
- Auto-scaling policies
