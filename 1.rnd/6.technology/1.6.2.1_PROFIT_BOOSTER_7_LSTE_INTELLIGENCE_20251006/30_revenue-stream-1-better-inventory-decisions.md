### **Revenue Stream 1: Better Inventory Decisions**

**Value:** $500K-$2M/year

**How:**

- Buy more of high-ROI/$/Day products (faster capital turnover)
- Skip low-ROI/$/Day products (avoid dead capital)
- Optimize inventory spend (6x turns per month instead of 2x)

**Example:**

- Current: $100K inventory, 2x turns/month = $200K/month revenue
- Optimized: $100K inventory, 6x turns/month = $600K/month revenue
- **Additional revenue: $400K/month = $4.8M/year**
