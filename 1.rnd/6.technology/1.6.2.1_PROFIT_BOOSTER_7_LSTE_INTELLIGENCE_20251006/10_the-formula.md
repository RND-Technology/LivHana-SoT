### **The Formula:**

```
ROI/$/Day = (Revenue - Cost) / (Days to Sell Out × Initial Investment)
```

**Example:**

- Product: "Sunset Sherbet Batch #4237"
- Cost: $1,000 (10 units @ $100 wholesale)
- Revenue: $2,500 (10 units @ $250 retail)
- Days to sell out: 5 days
- **ROI/$/Day = ($2,500 - $1,000) / (5 × $1,000) = $1,500 / $5,000 = 30% daily ROI**

**But also consider:**

- **LSTE Score:** 4.5/5 (high quality)
- **Review Count:** 47 reviews (high engagement)
- **Repeat Purchase:** 73% (customer loyalty)
- **Adjusted ROI/$/Day:** 30% × 1.5 (engagement multiplier) = **45% daily ROI**
