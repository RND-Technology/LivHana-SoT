## **ðŸ’Ž THE BILLION-DOLLAR INSIGHT**

**Current Market:**

- Cannabis dispensaries buy $10B+ in inventory per year
- 90% of decisions are based on "seller bullshit opinions"
- Average ROI/$/Day: 15-20% (slow capital turnover)

**If You Capture 1% Market Share:**

- 1% of $10B = $100M inventory decisions influenced
- If you help them increase ROI from 15% to 30% (2x)
- Value created: $100M Ã— 15% improvement = $15M/year
- If you charge 10% of value created: $1.5M/year revenue

**If You Capture 10% Market Share:**

- 10% of $10B = $1B inventory decisions influenced
- Value created: $1B Ã— 15% improvement = $150M/year
- If you charge 10% of value created: **$15M/year revenue**

**This is a UNICORN opportunity disguised as a "review system".**
