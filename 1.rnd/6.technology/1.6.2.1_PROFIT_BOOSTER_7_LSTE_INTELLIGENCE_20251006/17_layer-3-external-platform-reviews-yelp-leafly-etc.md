### **Layer 3: External Platform Reviews (Yelp, Leafly, etc.)**

**What it tells you:**

- Social proof (review count, star rating)
- Customer acquisition channel (where did they find you?)
- Sentiment analysis (positive, neutral, negative)
- Username → Customer ID matching

**Current Status:** ❌ NOT BUILT

**What's needed:**

1. **Review scraper** (Selenium/Puppeteer to scrape platforms)
2. **Customer matching** (username → email → customer ID)
3. **Sentiment analysis** (Claude Sonnet 4.5 to extract LSTE from text)
4. **Platform tracking** (add platform/username to customer records)
