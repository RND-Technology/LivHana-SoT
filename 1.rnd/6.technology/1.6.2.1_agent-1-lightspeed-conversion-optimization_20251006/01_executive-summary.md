## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

LivHana's LightSpeed integration is currently in **MOCK MODE** with a functional foundation but significant conversion optimization opportunities. The system successfully mirrors the Square integration architecture with 15-minute sync intervals to BigQuery, but lacks critical revenue-driving features identified in the Texas Takeover playbook.

**BOTTOM LINE:** The technical infrastructure is solid. The revenue optimization layer is missing.
