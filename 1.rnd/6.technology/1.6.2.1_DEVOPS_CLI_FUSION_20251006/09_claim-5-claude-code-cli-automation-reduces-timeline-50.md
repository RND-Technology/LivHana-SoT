### ⚠️ **CLAIM #5: "Claude Code CLI Automation" Reduces Timeline 50%+**

**Claimed Timeline:** 94 hours manual → 5-7 days with CLI automation
**Reality Check:** CLI can generate code faster, but deployment/testing/integration remains manual

**Actual Time Savings:**

- Code generation: 70% faster ✅
- API integration: 30% faster (still need to test endpoints, handle auth)
- Database setup: 50% faster (migrations auto-generated, but schema design requires human decisions)
- Testing: 10% faster (unit tests generated, but integration/E2E tests require manual validation)

**Revised Estimate:** 94 hours → ~60-70 hours with CLI assistance (not 40 hours)
