## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**This guide is a Tier-1 task breakdown** but assumes greenfield architecture.
**Trinity reality:** Must integrate with existing GCP infrastructure + backend codebase.

**Critical Path:**

1. Resolve database architecture (P0) → Determines all subsequent API work
2. Verify API access (P1) → Determines manual vs automated workflow
3. Deploy backend extensions (P1) → Enables verification + email automation
4. Manual LightSpeed work (P2) → Unblocks webstore launch
5. Email automation (P2) → Drives customer engagement
6. Analytics dashboard (P3) → Provides visibility post-launch

**ETA to launch-ready:** 5-7 days (assumes database architecture resolved in Day 1).

**Recommended Path:**

1. Run backend code audit (identify existing DB + API patterns)
2. Provision Cloud SQL if needed (or use existing Trinity DB)
3. Build verification endpoints (follow guide's API specs)
4. Manual LightSpeed customizations (age-gate, hero, product pages)
5. SendGrid domain auth + template setup
6. Looker Studio dashboard (faster than custom React)
7. Full integration test (Playwright + manual QA)
