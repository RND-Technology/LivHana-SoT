### What Worked Well

1. **Autonomous Agent Deployment** - Single agent converted 17 files in parallel
2. **Parallel npm Installs** - 3 services installed simultaneously (67% time savings)
3. **Systematic Conversion** - Starting with dependencies prevented cascading failures
4. **Incremental Testing** - Tested each service as it came up
