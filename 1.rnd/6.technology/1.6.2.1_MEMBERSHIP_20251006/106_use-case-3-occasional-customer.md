### Use Case 3: Occasional Customer

**Scenario:** Customer spends $100/month on products

**Without Membership:**

- Monthly spend: $100
- Annual spend: $1,200

**With Bronze ($47/month, 10% off):**

- Product cost: $100 Ã— 0.90 = $90
- Membership: $47
- Total: $137/month
- Annual total: $1,644
- **Not worth it - costs $444 more**

**Recommendation:** Wait until spending $470/month before joining
