### **4C. Start the Service**

```bash
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**

```
> reasoning-gateway@0.1.0 start
> node src/index.js

{"level":30,"time":...,"msg":"reasoning-gateway listening","port":4002}
{"level":30,"msg":"Self-improvement loop initialized"}
{"level":30,"msg":"Scheduled jobs started"}
```

**What to Look For:**

- ✅ "reasoning-gateway listening" on port 4002
- ✅ "Self-improvement loop started" (if enabled)
- ✅ NO "spawn /bin/sh EAGAIN" errors
- ✅ NO "Monthly refactoring report failed" spam

**If You See Spawn Errors:** Self-improvement bug fix didn't work. Tag me in!
