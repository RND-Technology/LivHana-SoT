### pino-papertrail

pino-papertrail is a transport that will forward logs to the [papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com) log service through an UDPv4 socket.

Given an application `foo` that logs via pino, and a papertrail destination that collects logs on port UDP `12345` on address `bar.papertrailapp.com`, you would use `pino-papertrail`
like so:

```
node yourapp.js | pino-papertrail --host bar.papertrailapp.com --port 12345 --appname foo
```
