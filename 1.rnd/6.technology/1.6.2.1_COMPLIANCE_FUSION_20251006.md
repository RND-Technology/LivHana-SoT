## LEGAL FOUNDATION ‚Ä¢ TIER-1 VALIDATED

### ‚úÖ **Federal Law: Hemp Farming Act 2018**

**Status:** COMPLIANT (assuming ‚â§0.3% Œî9-THC in all products)

**Key Requirements:**

1. **THCa flower is federally legal** if total Œî9-THC ‚â§0.3% by dry weight

### ‚úÖ **Texas Law: HB 1325 (2019) + SB 1115 (2023)**

**Status:** COMPLIANT (Texas permits hemp sales with restrictions)

**Key Requirements:**

1. **Hemp flower sales legal** in Texas if Œî9-THC ‚â§0.3%

---

### ‚úÖ **Banking Compliance: Square + Payment Processors**

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES VERIFICATION FLOW (Veriff + membership agreement)

**Why Banking Cares:**

- Cannabis (even legal hemp) is "high-risk" for fraud, chargebacks, and regulatory scrutiny
- Square requires **age/ID verification** + **terms agreement** to process hemp payments
- Failure to verify = account termination risk

**Square-Specific Requirements:**

1. **Veriff Age/ID Verification**
   - Customer uploads government-issued ID
   - Veriff confirms: (1) ID authentic, (2) Customer 21+, (3) Photo matches ID
   - Verification stored in database (not repeated for returning customers)

2. **Membership Agreement**
   - Customer signs terms acknowledging:
     - "I am 21+ years old"
     - "I understand this is hemp (‚â§0.3% Œî9-THC), not marijuana"
     - "I will not use this product in violation of any law"
     - "I consent to email/SMS marketing" (CAN-SPAM compliance)
   - IP address + timestamp logged (proof of agreement)

3. **Post-Purchase Verification Flow** (Implemented in Texas Takeover plan)
   - Orders accepted immediately (low friction checkout)
   - Post-purchase: Check if customer has Veriff + membership on file
   - If missing: Email with 72-hour countdown to complete verification
   - If not completed: Auto-refund to original payment method
   - **Success Metric:** 80%+ verification completion rate (prevent mass refunds)

**Compliance Checklist:**

- [ ] Veriff API integrated (existing system, verify credentials: `op item get veriff`)
- [ ] Age-gate modal collects consent (not Veriff, but initial age claim)
- [ ] Checkout requires email opt-in checkbox (CAN-SPAM compliance)
- [ ] Post-purchase verification flow tested (5-10 test orders before launch)
- [ ] Auto-refund logic implemented (72-hour countdown, Square Refunds API)

## CALIFORNIA PROP 65 WARNING ‚Ä¢ TOBACCO-FREE STATEMENT

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED (not legally required for hemp, but reduces liability)

**Background:**

- California Prop 65 requires warnings for products containing chemicals known to cause cancer/reproductive harm
- Hemp smoke (like any combusted plant material) may contain trace carcinogens
- **Not legally required** for hemp flower, but recommended for liability protection

**Recommended Warning (on product pages):**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Smoking or vaping any substance may expose you to chemicals
known to the State of California to cause cancer. This product is intended
for adult use only. Keep out of reach of children and pets.
```

**Implementation:**

- [ ] Add warning to product pages (below COA, above "Add to Cart")
- [ ] Add warning to Terms of Service
- [ ] Include in age-gate modal fine print (optional)

**Evidence Required:** Screenshot of product page with warning in `.evidence/2025-10-03/lightspeed-theme/prop65-warning.png`

## GOOGLE ADS & FACEBOOK ADS POLICIES ‚Ä¢ CANNABIS RESTRICTIONS

**Status:** üî¥ MAJOR RESTRICTIONS (THCa flower = HIGH RISK for ad account bans)

### **Google Ads Policy:**

- **Prohibited:** Ads promoting cannabis (including hemp flower with THCa)
- **Reason:** Google considers THCa flower "intoxicating" even if federally legal
- **Workaround:** Advertise "CBD products" or "hemp accessories" ‚Üí drive to site ‚Üí disclose THCa flower
- **Risk:** Account suspension if Google flags THCa flower ads

**Recommendation:** Avoid Google Ads OR use "CBD shop" targeting with no mention of THCa in ad copy

---

### **Facebook/Instagram Ads Policy:**

- **Prohibited:** Ads promoting "drugs, drug-related products, or use of illegal, prescription, or recreational drugs"
- **Hemp Exception:** "Non-ingestible" hemp products (topicals, accessories) allowed in some states
- **THCa Flower:** **PROHIBITED** (considered "ingestible" + "intoxicating")
- **Workaround:** Advertise "hemp lifestyle" content ‚Üí drive to site ‚Üí disclose THCa flower
- **Risk:** Ad account ban + no appeal (Facebook has zero tolerance)

**Recommendation for Texas Takeover:**

1. **Organic Social Only** (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X) ‚Äì No paid ads promoting THCa flower directly
2. **Paid Ads for "Hemp Education"** ‚Äì Run ads promoting blog posts about hemp legality, NOT products
3. **Retargeting Allowed** ‚Äì Pixel website visitors ‚Üí show dynamic ads to past visitors (lower risk)
4. **Influencer Marketing** ‚Äì Micro-influencers post about products (not ads, so no policy violation)

**Alternative Paid Channels:**

- Reddit Ads (more permissive for cannabis, target r/hempflowers, r/Texasents)
- Podcast Sponsorships (cannabis-friendly podcasts, direct reads)
- Google Display Network (banner ads on cannabis news sites, not Google Search)

**Evidence Required:** If attempting Facebook ads, screenshot of ad approval + policy compliance in `.evidence/2025-10-03/marketing/fb-ads-compliance.png`

## RISK MITIGATION ‚Ä¢ LEGAL SCENARIOS

### **Scenario 1: Customer Claims "Got Too High" / Product Liability**

**Risk:** Customer sues claiming THCa flower caused harm (anxiety, paranoia, accident)
**Mitigation:**

1. Terms of Service include **liability waiver** ("You assume all risks of use")
2. Product pages include **dosage guidance** ("Start low, go slow if new to THCa")
3. Age-gate + Veriff prove customer was 21+ and consented to adult use
4. No medical claims on site (cannot claim "safe" or "therapeutic")
5. **Insurance:** General liability insurance with cannabis rider (check if Reggie & Dro has this)

**Action:** Verify insurance coverage via `op item get insurance` OR contact insurance broker

---

### **Scenario 2: Law Enforcement / DEA Inquiry**

**Risk:** DEA or Texas DPS investigates Reggie & Dro for "illegal cannabis sales"
**Mitigation:**

1. **All products have COAs** showing Œî9-THC ‚â§0.3% (federal compliance)
2. **No interstate shipping to illegal states** (shipping logs show only legal states)
3. **Age verification records** (Veriff logs prove 21+ enforcement)
4. **No medical claims** (cannot be charged with unlicensed medical practice)
5. **Legal counsel on retainer** (Andrea Steel or cannabis attorney, have contact ready)

**Action:** Keep digital archive of all COAs + Veriff logs + shipping manifests (audit-ready)

---

### **Scenario 3: Square Terminates Payment Processing**

**Risk:** Square flags Reggie & Dro as "high-risk" and terminates account
**Mitigation:**

1. **Maintain 80%+ verification completion rate** (show Square you're enforcing age checks)
2. **Keep chargeback rate <1%** (respond to disputes within 24 hours, provide tracking)
3. **Backup payment processor** (Stripe, PayPal, crypto, ACH ‚Äì have alternative ready)
4. **Clear product descriptions** (no ambiguity about "hemp" vs "marijuana")

**Action:** Research backup payment processors (Stripe for hemp, PayPal may ban, crypto = Bitcoin/USDC)

---

### **Scenario 4: Email Spam Complaints / SendGrid Suspension**

**Risk:** High spam complaint rate (>0.5%) ‚Üí SendGrid suspends account
**Mitigation:**

1. **Only email confirmed opt-ins** (no purchased lists, no scraped emails)
2. **Unsubscribe link works** (test before launch)
3. **Segment properly** (don't send launch emails to people who unsubscribed from newsletters)
4. **Monitor spam rate daily** (SendGrid dashboard, pause if >0.3%)

**Action:** Set up SendGrid alert (email if spam rate >0.5%) ‚Üí automatic pause threshold
