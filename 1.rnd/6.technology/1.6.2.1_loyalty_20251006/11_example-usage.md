## Example Usage

```ts
const accountId = 'account_id2';

try {
  const { result, ...httpResponse } = await loyaltyApi.retrieveLoyaltyAccount(accountId);
  // Get more response info...
  // const { statusCode, headers } = httpResponse;
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ApiError) {
    const errors = error.result;
    // const { statusCode, headers } = error;
  }
}
```

# Accumulate Loyalty Points

Adds points earned from a purchase to a [loyalty account](../../doc/models/loyalty-account.md).

* If you are using the Orders API to manage orders, provide the `order_id`. Square reads the order
  to compute the points earned from both the base loyalty program and an associated
  [loyalty promotion](../../doc/models/loyalty-promotion.md). For purchases that qualify for multiple accrual
  rules, Square computes points based on the accrual rule that grants the most points.
  For purchases that qualify for multiple promotions, Square computes points based on the most
  recently created promotion. A purchase must first qualify for program points to be eligible for promotion points.

* If you are not using the Orders API to manage orders, provide `points` with the number of points to add.
  You must first perform a client-side computation of the points earned from the loyalty program and
  loyalty promotion. For spend-based and visit-based programs, you can call [CalculateLoyaltyPoints](../../doc/api/loyalty.md#calculate-loyalty-points)
  to compute the points earned from the base loyalty program. For information about computing points earned from a loyalty promotion, see
  [Calculating promotion points](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/loyalty-api/loyalty-promotions#calculate-promotion-points).

```ts
async accumulateLoyaltyPoints(
  accountId: string,
  body: AccumulateLoyaltyPointsRequest,
  requestOptions?: RequestOptions
): Promise<ApiResponse<AccumulateLoyaltyPointsResponse>>
```
