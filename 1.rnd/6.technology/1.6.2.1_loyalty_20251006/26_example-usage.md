## Example Usage

```ts
const programId = 'program_id0';

try {
  const { result, ...httpResponse } = await loyaltyApi.retrieveLoyaltyProgram(programId);
  // Get more response info...
  // const { statusCode, headers } = httpResponse;
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ApiError) {
    const errors = error.result;
    // const { statusCode, headers } = error;
  }
}
```

# Calculate Loyalty Points

Calculates the number of points a buyer can earn from a purchase. Applications might call this endpoint
to display the points to the buyer.

* If you are using the Orders API to manage orders, provide the `order_id` and (optional) `loyalty_account_id`.
  Square reads the order to compute the points earned from the base loyalty program and an associated
  [loyalty promotion](../../doc/models/loyalty-promotion.md).

* If you are not using the Orders API to manage orders, provide `transaction_amount_money` with the
  purchase amount. Square uses this amount to calculate the points earned from the base loyalty program,
  but not points earned from a loyalty promotion. For spend-based and visit-based programs, the `tax_mode`
  setting of the accrual rule indicates how taxes should be treated for loyalty points accrual.
  If the purchase qualifies for program points, call
  [ListLoyaltyPromotions](../../doc/api/loyalty.md#list-loyalty-promotions) and perform a client-side computation
  to calculate whether the purchase also qualifies for promotion points. For more information, see
  [Calculating promotion points](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/loyalty-api/loyalty-promotions#calculate-promotion-points).

```ts
async calculateLoyaltyPoints(
  programId: string,
  body: CalculateLoyaltyPointsRequest,
  requestOptions?: RequestOptions
): Promise<ApiResponse<CalculateLoyaltyPointsResponse>>
```
