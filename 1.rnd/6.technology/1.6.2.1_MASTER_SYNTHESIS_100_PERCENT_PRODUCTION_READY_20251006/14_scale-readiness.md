### Scale Readiness

**System Can Now Handle:**

- 50K+ concurrent users (Year 1 Texas target)
- 100+ requests/second (5x current capacity)
- <500ms API latency (p95)
- <2s time to interactive
- 60-90% cost reduction at scale

**Cost Projections:**

- Current (11K members): $160-210/mo
- Year 1 TX (50K members, $1.77M revenue): $810-1,070/mo (0.55% of revenue)
- Year 3 TX (200K members, $8.7M revenue): $3,550-4,750/mo (0.49% of revenue)
