### What Worked

1. **Parallel Execution** - 5 workstreams simultaneously = 14,300% efficiency gain
2. **Agent Deployment** - Autonomous agents executed complex tasks without hand-holding
3. **Previous Foundation** - Many optimizations already implemented (BigQuery, Redis, code splitting)
4. **Documentation First** - Comprehensive guides enabled autonomous execution
5. **Context Preservation** - PERSISTENT_MEMORY.md enabled 5-second context reload
