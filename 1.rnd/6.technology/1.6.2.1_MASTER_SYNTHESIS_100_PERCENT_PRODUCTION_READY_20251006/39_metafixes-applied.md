### Metafixes Applied

1. **Always scan entire project** - Not just one service
2. **Verify current state** - Never trust cached/stale reports
3. **Test after every change** - Catch regressions early
4. **Document everything** - Enable future sessions to resume instantly
5. **Commit frequently** - Preserve work in case of interruption
