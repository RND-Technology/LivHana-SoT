# Customer Sort Field

Specifies customer attributes as the sort key to customer profiles returned from a search.

## Enumeration

## Fields

| Name | Description |
|  --- | --- |

If<br>neither name field is set, string comparison is performed using one of the<br>remaining fields in the following order: `company_name`, `email`,<br>`phone_number`. |
| `CREATED_AT` | Use the creation date attribute (`created_at`) of customer profiles as the sort key. |
