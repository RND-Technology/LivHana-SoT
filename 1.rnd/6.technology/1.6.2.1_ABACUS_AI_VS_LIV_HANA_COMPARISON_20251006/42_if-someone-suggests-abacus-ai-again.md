## ğŸ’¬ IF SOMEONE SUGGESTS ABACUS.AI AGAIN

**Response**:

> "We already built what Abacus.AI sells, but better:
>
> - **Autonomous Agent**: âœ… Claude Sonnet 4 (better than their workflows)
> - **RAG System**: âœ… Custom embeddings (cannabis-specific)
> - **Reasoning**: âœ… DeepSeek R1 (cheaper, stronger)
> - **Memory**: âœ… Learning Engine (they don't have this)
> - **Self-Improvement**: âœ… Built and running (they don't have this)
> - **Cost**: âœ… $52-80/month vs their $110-150/month
> - **Control**: âœ… Full source code vs their platform
>
> Adding Abacus.AI would:
>
> - Cost +75-150% more
> - Give us less control
> - Lock us to their platform
> - Provide zero new capabilities
>
> **Hard pass.**"
