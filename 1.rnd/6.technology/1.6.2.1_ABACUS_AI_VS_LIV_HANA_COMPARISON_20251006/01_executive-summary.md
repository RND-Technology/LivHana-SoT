## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Verdict**: ❌ **SKIP** - Not worth adding to stack

**Why**: Abacus.AI solves problems Liv Hana already solved better, faster, and cheaper with direct API integrations.

**TL;DR**:

- Abacus = Enterprise wrapper around APIs you already use
- Liv Hana = Direct API integration with custom orchestration
- Abacus = $10-20/user/month + credit costs
- Liv Hana = Pay actual API costs only
- **Result**: Abacus adds cost and abstraction with zero benefit
