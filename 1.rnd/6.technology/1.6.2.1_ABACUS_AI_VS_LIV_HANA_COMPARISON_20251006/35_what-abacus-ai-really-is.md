### What Abacus.AI Really Is

**Abacus.AI = Wrapper Around APIs You Already Use**

That's it. That's the whole business model.

They:

1. Take Claude API, GPT API, etc.
2. Add a no-code interface
3. Add a credit system to obscure costs
4. Mark up the price
5. Sell to enterprises who don't want to build

**For a company like Liv Hana that:**

- Already has engineering talent
- Already built custom AI systems
- Needs domain-specific (cannabis) features
- Is cost-conscious
- Values control and flexibility

**Abacus.AI provides**: Negative value

You'd be paying $58-98/month extra to:

- Lose control
- Add latency
- Get vendor lock-in
- Remove customization
- Obscure costs

**That's a bad deal.**
