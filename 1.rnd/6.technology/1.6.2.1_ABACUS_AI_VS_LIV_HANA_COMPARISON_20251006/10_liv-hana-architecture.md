**Pros**:

- Direct API access (lower latency)
- Full control over prompts
- Pay only for what you use (no markup)
- No vendor lock-in
- Custom optimizations
- Domain-specific (cannabis, Texas)

**Cons**:

- Requires engineering effort (already built)
- Need to manage integrations (already done)
- No visual workflow builder (don't need it)

**Winner**: Liv Hana (unless you need no-code, which you don't)
