### Abacus.AI Architecture

```
Your App → Abacus.AI Platform → LLM APIs (Claude, GPT, etc)
                ↓
        Proprietary Orchestration
                ↓
        Credit-Based Billing
```

**Pros**:

- No-code/low-code interface
- Pre-built workflows
- Multi-LLM support in one platform

**Cons**:

- Abstraction layer adds latency
- Less control over prompts
- Credit system obscures real costs
- Vendor lock-in
- Can't optimize prompts directly
