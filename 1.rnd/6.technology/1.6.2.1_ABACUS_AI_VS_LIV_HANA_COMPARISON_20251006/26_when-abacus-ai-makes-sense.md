### When Abacus.AI Makes Sense

✅ You're a Fortune 500 with non-technical teams
✅ You need generic enterprise AI (not domain-specific)
✅ You want no-code/low-code (not custom engineering)
✅ You're okay with vendor lock-in
✅ Cost isn't a concern (enterprise budget)
✅ You don't have AI/ML talent in-house
