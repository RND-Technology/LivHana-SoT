### 1. SQL Aggregation (Primary Impact)

```sql
-- Before: Fetch 1000 rows, filter in JavaScript
SELECT * FROM payments WHERE created_at > ... LIMIT 1000

-- After: Single aggregation query
WITH time_ranges AS (...)
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN created_at >= day_start THEN amount END) / 100 AS todayRevenue,
  COUNT(*) AS totalTransactions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS totalCustomers
FROM payments
WHERE created_at >= ... AND status = 'COMPLETED'
```

**Impact:** 86% faster (2.5s â†’ 350ms)
