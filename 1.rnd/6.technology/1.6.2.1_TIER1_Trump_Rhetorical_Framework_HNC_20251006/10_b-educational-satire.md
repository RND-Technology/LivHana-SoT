#### **B. EDUCATIONAL SATIRE**

**Pattern Identification**:

- Successful cannabis memes combine humor + education
- Teaching about terpenes, policy differences, cultivation
- Entertainment-first, education secondary

**Trump Technique**:

- Repetition for memorability (rally speeches repeat phrases 20+ times)
- Simple language for accessibility (4th-6th grade level)
- "Sermocinatio" (recalled conversations with experts)

**HNC Adaptation Strategy**:

- Repeat key policy points across 84 episodes
- "Schedule I is a disaster, total disaster" becomes catchphrase
- Make rescheduling/descheduling distinction comedic but clear
- Trump character recalls talking to "the best growers, tremendous people"

**84-Episode Arc Strategy**:
Allows repetition like Trump rallies (average 82 minutes with phrase repetition for rhythm)—build familiarity through consistency.

**Example Script**:

```
"Schedule I. Do you know what Schedule I means? It means no medical value. ZERO. But 38 states—38!—said cannabis has medical value. So either 38 states are wrong, or the DEA is wrong. I'll let you decide. But I'll give you a hint: the DEA is wrong, folks."
```
