#### **A. SELF-AWARE SATIRE**

**Critical Finding**: Trump **NEVER** uses self-deprecating humor.

- Explicitly stated: "I don't see the point in taking shots at myself when others are shooting at me" (2024 Al Smith Dinner)
- Zero self-mockery in 9+ years of political speeches
- This creates **satirical vulnerability**

**Strategic Opportunity**:
HNC can do what Trump won't—make Trump-style character self-deprecating about cannabis advocacy, creating meta-humor.

**Adaptation Strategy**:

- Animated Trump character promoting cannabis WITH self-awareness he'd never have
- "Folks, I've been wrong about some things, but on cannabis, I was saved for a reason—to deschedule this beautiful plant"
- Audience "in on joke" that real Trump would never admit error
- Makes satire both tribute and roast simultaneously

**Example Script**:

```
"Look, I'll admit it—I didn't always understand cannabis. Big mistake. HUGE. But I learned. I evolved. And now I'm the biggest cannabis advocate, maybe ever. People are saying, 'Trump, you're tremendous on cannabis policy.' And it's true."
[Note: Audience knows real Trump would never say "I was wrong"]
```
