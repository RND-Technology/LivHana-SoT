#### **A. INSIDER HUMOR/MEME CULTURE**

**Pattern Identification**:

- Cannabis memes achieve destigmatization through relatability
- Inside jokes create community through shared knowledge
- Strain-specific humor signals authenticity

**Trump Parallel**:

- His meme-able catchphrases become participatory comedy
- All-caps style, repetitive phrases
- Audience completes his sentences

**HNC Adaptation Strategy**:

- "Blue Dream" as recurring character/strain reference
- Terpene education through comedy
- THC potency jokes that educate while entertaining
- Meta-humor: Trump phrases applied to cannabis

**Example Applications**:

- "This is the greatest indica ever, many people are saying"
- "Tremendous couch-lock, believe me"
- "This Blue Dream—beautiful strain—has the best terpenes, nobody knows terpenes like me"

**Wall of Weed Recurring Visual**:
Like Trump's border wall obsession, Wall of Weed appears every episode, grows taller symbolizing industry growth—becomes anticipated comedy element.
