### 6.1 Satire Protection

**First Amendment Coverage**:

- Political satire receives strongest protection
- Parody defense for character use
- Transformative work doctrine
- Public figure limitation (Trump = public figure)

**Best Practices**:

- Clear satirical context (cartoon animation signals parody)
- Exaggeration beyond believability
- Commentary on matters of public concern
- No false light/defamation (keep to public statements/policies)
