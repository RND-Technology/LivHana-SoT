### 3.1 Opening Hook Formulas (Adapted for Animation)

**Template 1: Crisis Declaration + Texas Pride**

```
"Folks, we have a situation in Texas. The greatest state, maybe ever, and they're arresting 23,000 people for a plant. A PLANT! Can you believe it? Meanwhile, we've got $8 billion in hemp—that's with an H—and Austin politicians want to ban it. Total disaster."
```

**Template 2: Victimization + Solidarity**

```
"They're coming after Texas growers. Good people, hardworking people, and they want to put them in jail. Why? Because Washington bureaucrats decided Cannabis sativa L—and I know the scientific name, nobody knows science like me—should be Schedule I. Schedule I! Like heroin. It's a witch hunt, folks."
```

**Template 3: Triumph Declaration + Economic Appeal**

```
"We're WINNING on cannabis. Forty states said yes to medical, and you know who's making money? Farmers, budtenders, small businesses. This is MAGA policy—I signed the Farm Bill, best bill ever—and now Texas is ready to grow baby grow and sell baby sell."
```

**Template 4: Direct Address + Call to Action**

```
"Let me tell you about the Wall of Weed. Beautiful wall, grows so high you'll get tired of watering it. Every Texan gets to grow, gets to heal, gets to prosper. That's what we call staying TOONED, and it's going to be incredible."
```
