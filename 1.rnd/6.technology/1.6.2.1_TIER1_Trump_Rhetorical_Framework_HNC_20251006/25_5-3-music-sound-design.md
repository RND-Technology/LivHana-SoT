### 5.3 Music & Sound Design

**Patriotic Openings**:

- Brief orchestral American theme (3-5 seconds)
- Transitions to comedic/satirical music
- Establishes context before subversion

**Trump-Associated Audio**:

- Rally crowd sounds (cheering, "USA" chants)
- Airhorns for emphasis
- Cash register sounds (economic claims)
- Dramatic "DUN DUN DUN" (crisis declarations)
