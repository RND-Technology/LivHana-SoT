#### **D. PATRIOTIC/PROVIDENTIAL FRAMING**

**Pattern Identification**:

- "I was saved for a reason" (post-assassination attempt)
- Providential destiny narrative
- American flag omnipresence
- War metaphors (54% of Trump rhetoric)
- Religious undertones without overt Christianity

**HNC Adaptation Strategy**:

- Cannabis as **patriotic crop** (founding fathers grew hemp)
- Texas agricultural heritage restoration
- "Make America Grow Again" slogan adaptation
- Faith-forward compassion framework (medical patients)
- "Biblical justification for medical marijuana" (emerging conservative argument)

**Production Style**:

- Opening shots: Texas flag, bluebonnets, frontier imagery
- Patriotic music cues before satire begins
- Historical references (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson grew hemp)
- Establish patriotic context before comedy

**Example Script**:

```
"You know who grew hemp? George Washington. Thomas Jefferson. The founding fathers—the greatest Americans ever—they grew hemp. It's our heritage. Texas hemp built this country. And now politicians say it's illegal? That's un-American, folks."
```
