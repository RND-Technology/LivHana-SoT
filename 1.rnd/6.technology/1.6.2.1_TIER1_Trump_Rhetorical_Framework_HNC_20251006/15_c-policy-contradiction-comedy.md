#### **C. POLICY CONTRADICTION COMEDY**

**Pattern Identification**:

- Trump signed 2018 Farm Bill legalizing hemp
- Yet hesitates on full cannabis rescheduling
- Creates cognitive dissonance ripe for comedy

**HNC Adaptation Strategy**:

- Mine this contradiction for recurring comedy
- "I legalized hemp, beautiful hemp, but cannabis? We'll see what happens, maybe in two weeks"
- "Two weeks" becomes running joke (Trump's common delay phrase)
- Trump carried Texas, but **79% of Texans support regulation**—satirize the gap

**Example Script**:

```
"I signed the Farm Bill. Best bill ever. Legalized hemp nationwide. But cannabis? Different plant. Totally different. Except—and not many people know this—they're the same plant. But different. We'll look at it. In two weeks, maybe."
