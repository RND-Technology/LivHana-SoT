#### **C. COUNTER-MESSAGING HUMOR**

**Pattern Identification**:

- Cannabis community rapidly deconstructs DEA fear campaigns
- Uses humor + evidence to undermine prohibition messaging
- Turns opponent arguments into comedy material

**Trump Parallel**:

- "Fake news" attacks on mainstream media
- Creates distrust of official narratives
- Positions himself as truth-teller against corrupt system

**HNC Adaptation Strategy**:

- Satirize prohibitionist claims using Trump's hyperbolic style
- "They say one dab equals dozens of jointsâ€”DOZENS! Can you believe it?"
- "Total witch hunt against cannabis users"
- Protected speech: Satire shield allows aggressive mockery

**Example Script**:

```
"The government says cannabis is dangerous. More dangerous than cocaine. More dangerous than meth. You believe that? Of course you don't. Nobody believes that. It's propaganda, folks. FAKE SCIENCE. And everyone knows it except the politicians."
```
