### 3.2 Three-Act Episode Structure

**Act 1: The Problem** (60-90 seconds)

- **Identify prohibition failures**: Arrests, black market, lost tax revenue
- **Name villains**: DEA bureaucrats, Lt. Gov. Patrick, "Prohibition Pete"
- **Create urgency**: "Texas is losing billions while criminals profit"
- **Trump Device**: All-caps title cards "TOTAL DISASTER" or "WITCH HUNT"

**Example Opening**:

```
[Visual: Texas map with red "PROHIBITED" stamp]
"Texas. The Lone Star State. Land of freedom and liberty. Except—and this is a big except—if you want to use cannabis for medicine. Then? JAIL. That's right, folks. In Texas, you can carry a gun, but not a joint. Does that make sense? No. It's a disaster."
```

**Act 2: The Hero/Solution** (120-150 seconds)

- **Position cannabis descheduling as answer** (not just rescheduling)
- **Use Trump-style character as unlikely advocate**: "Only I can fix it"
- **Showcase Texas opportunity**: Jobs, tax revenue, agricultural heritage
- **Trump Technique**: "Sermocinatio" (recalled conversations)

**Example Middle**:

```

"I was talking to a Texas farmer—beautiful farm, by the way, tremendous soil—and he said, 'Mr. President'—they all call me Mr. President still—'we could grow cannabis here. Make billions.' I said, 'You're right. Why aren't we doing this?' He said, 'Politicians.' Of course. Always the politicians."
```

**Act 3: The Vision** (60-90 seconds)

- **Future promise**: "We will make Texas the cannabis capital of America"
- **Actionable next step**: Deschedule Cannabis sativa L entirely
- **Restoration narrative**: Return to founding fathers' hemp farms
- **Call to Action**: "Stay TOONED," support descheduling
- **Visual Payoff**: Wall of Weed grows taller, Texas flag waves

**Example Closing**:

```

"Here's what we're going to do. We're going to deschedule cannabis. Completely. Take it off Schedule I, make it like tomatoes. And then? Texas is going to BOOM. Jobs, prosperity, freedom. That's the Texas THC Tale. Stay TOONED, because this is happening, folks. Believe me."
