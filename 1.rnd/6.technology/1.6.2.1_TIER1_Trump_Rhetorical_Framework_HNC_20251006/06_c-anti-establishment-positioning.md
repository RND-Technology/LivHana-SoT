#### **C. ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT POSITIONING**

**Pattern Identification**:

- "Drain the swamp" rhetoric
- "Deep state" conspiracy framing
- Elites vs. forgotten Americans
- Victimization as proof of fighting for "the people"
- Legal persecution as badge of honor

**HNC Adaptation Strategy**:

- Cannabis prohibition = bureaucratic tyranny
- DEA as "deep state" preventing economic opportunity
- **23,000 Texas arrests annually** while politicians profit
- Austin elites (Lt. Gov. Patrick) opposing **79% of Texas residents**

**Villain Character Development**:

- **"Prohibition Pete"**: Bureaucrat protecting failed system
- **Lt. Gov. Patrick**: Out-of-touch elite blocking will of people
- **"Big Pharma Bob"**: Corporate interests over patients

**Satirical Entry Point**:
Trump's own rescheduling hesitation becomes comedy materialâ€”"Even Trump knows it's time, but the swamp fights back"

**Example Script**:

```
"The swamp doesn't want cannabis legal. Why? Follow the money. Big Pharma donates to politicians, politicians keep cannabis illegal, sick people buy expensive pills. It's a racket, folks. Total corruption. We need to drain the swamp and free the plant."
```
