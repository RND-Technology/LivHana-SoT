#### **B. ECONOMIC PROSPERITY TRIGGERS**

**Pattern Identification**:

- Job creation specifics (not vague promises)
- "Billions and billions" hyperbolic numbers
- Tax cuts, "winning," competition with other regions
- Appeals to 56% non-college voters citing financial decline anxiety

**HNC Adaptation Strategy**:

- Cannabis industry **149,000+ American jobs**
- **$8 billion Texas hemp economy**
- **50,000 Texas jobs** at stake
- **$6 billion projected tax revenue**

**Satirical Hook Examples**:

- "Nobody has ever grown weed like Texas will grow weed, believe me"
- "Beautiful weed, the best weed ever, tremendous quality"
- "We're going to win so much on cannabis, you'll get tired of winning"

**Wall of Weed Integration**:
Physical prosperity symbol (like Trump's border wall) representing economic abundance—visual metaphor that resonates with MAGA base.

**Example Script**:

```
"Oklahoma is making BILLIONS on cannabis. BILLIONS. Colorado? They're laughing all the way to the bank. And Texas? We're arresting people. We're spending money to put Texans in jail while Oklahoma gets rich. That's not winning—that's losing, bigly."
```
