#### **B. EXAGGERATED AUTHENTICITY**

**Pattern Identification**:

- Trump's rambling 82-minute rallies
- "The weave" tangential speaking style
- Contradictions within same speech
- Stream-of-consciousness delivery

**Satire Entry Point**:
Exaggerate the exaggeration—make Trump-style character even MORE hyperbolic about cannabis than Trump is about anything.

**HNC Adaptation Strategy**:

- Character goes on 30-second tangent about "the greatest terpenes, nobody knows terpenes like me"
- Returns to policy point after seeming digression
- Mimics his visual mannerisms (hand gestures, facial expressions) in animation
- Instant recognizability for instant comedy

**Example Script**:

```
