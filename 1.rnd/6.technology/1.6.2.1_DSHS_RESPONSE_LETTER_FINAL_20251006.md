Dear Jessica Fierros and DSHS Compliance Team,

Thank you for your continued professionalism and dedication to protecting Texas consumers under HB 1325. I respectfully submit this formal response to the June 17, 2025 inspection findings. All violative products were removed immediately on the date of inspection (June 17, 2025), and corrective actions have been completed as outlined below.

## 1. CORRECTIONS MADE TO RESOLVE VIOLATIVE CONDITIONS

### Violation 1: Smokable Hemp Products

**Products:** GovernMint Oasis THCa, White Peach Bellini THCa  
**Correction:** Products removed from retail shelves on June 17, 2025. Marketing language reviewed and sanitized to remove smoking implications. Products relabeled with compliant descriptions.

### Violation 2: Non-Accredited Laboratory Testing

**Products:** Lavender Jack THCa Preroll, Royal Dawg CBD Preroll, Secret Cookies THCa Preroll  
**Correction:** Partnered with KCA Labs (ISO/IEC 17025 accredited) as primary testing partner. All cited products re-tested through KCA Labs with new COAs generated.

### Violation 3: Missing Safety Panel Tests

**Products:** All cited products  
**Tests Missing:** Heavy metals, pesticides, residual solvents, pathogens  
**Correction:** Full-panel testing ordered through KCA Labs including heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury), pesticides (all TX-required), residual solvents (USP <467>), microbial contaminants (Salmonella, E. coli, Aspergillus, yeast/mold, C. botulinum), mycotoxins (Aflatoxins, Ochratoxin A).

### Violation 4: Missing QR Code URLs

**Products:** Tejas Tonic Natural Lime, Royal Dawg CBD Preroll, Lavender Jack THCa Preroll, Secret Cookies THCa Preroll  
**Correction:** QR codes generated and applied to all product labels linking to full COA, batch information, manufacturer details, and required disclosures.

### Violation 5: Label Information (Non-CHP Observations)

**Missing:** Manufacturer address, net weight statements  
**Correction:** All labels reprinted with full manufacturer address (19141 Stone Oak Pkwy Ste 403, San Antonio, TX 78258) and accurate net weight statements per product.

### IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION: Hempress 3 COA

**Correction:** The Hempress 3 Boutique CBD Flower DID have a full panel COA that was provided to the inspector on June 17, 2025. This appears to be an oversight in the inspection report. I am resubmitting this COA as Attachment A.

## 4. CONTEXT AND COMMITMENT

### Financial Hardship Context

Since a burglary on September 28, 2023 resulted in a $250,000 loss of inventory and COAs, we have operated under severe financial constraints while remaining transparent and cooperative with DSHS. The hemp market is greatly unaware of the need for full panel testing, and I have been aware of this requirement but have been in financial stress since the burglary. This year has been especially challenging with the fight against prohibition and Square losing its ability to sell online, leaving us down for five months. We are just now getting our ability to sell back online, and we have been dwindling in inventory.

### Current Status and Path Forward

While we do not currently have full panel testing for all products due to financial constraints, we are in the process of implementing comprehensive testing through our partnership with KCA Labs. Our strategy has become to partner with other bigger brands to pool money together for large bulk test purchases from KCA Labs, and this deal is in the making and in the works.

### Industry Leadership and Policy Alignment

Our mission extends beyond compliance: we are building solutions for the entire industry. The Texas Full Panel COA initiative and WizzBang CYA (Cover Your Assets) program represent our commitment to solving these problems for consumers, regulators, and the industry. This work aligns with the Texas Truth & Safety Act (TTSA) and American Cannabis Freedom Act (ACFA), advancing truth, transparency, and economic prosperity for Texas producers.

### Advocacy for DSHS Enforcement

I have been a public advocate for Jessica Fierros and DSHS enforcement authority. I have been quoted in social media singing her praises as competent and capable of inspecting and enforcing existing regulations put in place in 2019 through HB 1325. I have been through two inspections and know full well that DSHS is a dedicated agency able to issue licenses, inspect, embargo, detain, destroy, issue fines, etc. I have been cooperatively working with DSHS since my first inspection just a week prior to the burglary in 2023.

## 5. REQUEST FOR PARTNERSHIP AND RULEMAKING PARTICIPATION

I am grateful for Inspector Jessica Fierros's fair enforcement and welcome continued dialogue with DSHS and the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) team during upcoming rulemaking under Governor Greg Abbott's executive order. Our goal is to be a model operator and partner in defining the next generation of testing and labeling standards for Cannabis sativa L.

I am available to participate in any stakeholder discussion or rulemaking session to help DSHS implement these standards statewide. I believe that responsible self-regulation works and counters prohibition arguments, supporting the principles of age-gating, accredited labs, and child-safe packaging over bans.

## 7. CONCLUSION

All violations were corrected as of October 1, 2025. We acknowledge the importance of ongoing compliance and view this as an opportunity to lead Texas toward a unified, safe, and transparent hemp industry. We welcome further inspection and collaboration with DSHS on testing standards and rulemaking.

I am committed to working with DSHS and Jessica Fierros directly to bring the Texas Full Panel COA standard to the market to solve these problems for consumers, regulators, and the industry. Together, we can establish Texas as the gold standard for hemp safety and compliance.
