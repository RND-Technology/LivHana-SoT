### Example: Customer requests "Add dark mode to dashboard"

**What Claude Autonomous Agent Does:**

```javascript
// 1. Load ALL context
const context = {
  codebase: await searchCode('dashboard themes'),
  designSystem: await searchNotion('design guidelines'),
  previousFeatures: await searchBigQuery('SELECT * FROM features WHERE status=implemented'),
  testPatterns: await searchCode('*.test.js'),
  deploymentProcess: await searchNotion('deployment checklist')
};

// 2. Analyze with FULL business context
const analysis = await claude.analyze(`
Add dark mode to dashboard.

EXISTING CODE:
${context.codebase}

DESIGN GUIDELINES:
${context.designSystem}

SIMILAR FEATURES WE'VE BUILT:
${context.previousFeatures}

TEST PATTERNS WE USE:
${context.testPatterns}

DEPLOYMENT PROCESS:
${context.deploymentProcess}

Analyze: What files need changes? What tests needed? What's the risk?
`);

// 3. Generate implementation with YOUR patterns
const implementation = await claude.generate(`
Based on analysis, generate code following OUR patterns:
- Use Material-UI (we use this everywhere)
- Follow our component structure (we have examples)
- Match our test style (we use Vitest)
- Include JSDoc comments (our standard)
- Follow our Git commit format

Generate complete implementation.
`);

// 4. Execute with safety checks
await autonomousAgent.execute({
  analysis,
  implementation,
  safetyChecks: [
    'Run existing tests',
    'Verify no breaking changes',
    'Check performance impact',
    'Validate accessibility'
  ]
});
```

**Result:** Dark mode added using YOUR coding style, YOUR patterns, YOUR infrastructure. Not generic - EXACTLY how you'd do it yourself.
