### Test 3: Business Decision Next Year

```
Jesse: "Should we expand to Colorado?"

Claude (WITHOUT context): ❌
Generic analysis, no specific data

Claude (WITH our system): ✅
"Based on your Texas success (11,348 customers,
$1M/month), Colorado analysis:

Pros:
- Similar demographics to Stone Oak customers
- Mature market (easier compliance)
- Your CDFA PDP transfers (R&D WY already has license)

Cons:
- Need 3-6 months for licensing
- Requires $500K capital for 3 locations
- Andrew's operations already at capacity

Recommendation: Wait until Q2 2026 when:
- Christopher has CoS systems mature
- Seed round complete ($750K)
- TX operations on autopilot

Data sources: Your customer analytics, license database,
team capacity from pilot training progress, and
financial projections from BigQuery."
