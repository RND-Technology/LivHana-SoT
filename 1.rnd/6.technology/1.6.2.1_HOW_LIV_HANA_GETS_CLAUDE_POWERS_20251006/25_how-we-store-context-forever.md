### How We Store Context Forever

**1. Notion Webhook → Real-time Knowledge**

```javascript
// Every time you update Notion
Notion.onChange → webhook → process → BigQuery
Result: Context updated instantly, never stale
```

**2. Gmail Sync → Communication History**

```javascript
// Every day at 3 AM
Gmail.sync → extract patterns → BigQuery → vector embeddings
Result: All conversations searchable semantically
```

**3. Memory Learning → Customer Intelligence**

```javascript
// After EVERY interaction
Interaction → extract insights → update profile → predict next action
Result: Gets smarter with every conversation
```

**4. Self-Improvement → Operational Intelligence**

```javascript
// Daily analysis
Analyze yesterday → extract patterns → propose improvements → learn
Result: System improves itself automatically
```

**5. Vector Embeddings → Semantic Search**

```javascript
// For ANY query
Query → generate embedding → search similar → rank by relevance → retrieve top 10
Result: Finds relevant context even with different wording
```
