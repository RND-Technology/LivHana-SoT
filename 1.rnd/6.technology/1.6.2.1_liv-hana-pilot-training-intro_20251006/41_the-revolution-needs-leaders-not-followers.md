### **The Revolution Needs Leaders, Not Followers**

This isn't a typical corporate training program where you learn to follow procedures.
This is **leadership development** for people who will **shape the future**.
This is **combat training** for a **war against prohibition**.
This is **pioneer training** for people who will **settle new territory**.

**You're not learning to work IN the system - you're learning to CHANGE the system.**
