### **Texas Leads, You Lead Texas, Together We Lead America**

**"Grow baby grow and sell baby sell"** isn't just a catchy slogan - it's your **rallying cry** to expand freedom, create prosperity, and heal a nation torn apart by failed drug policies.

**"Grow, Sell, Heal"** represents the **complete cycle** of cannabis freedom:

- **Grow**: Cultivation rights, agricultural freedom, economic development
- **Sell**: Commerce rights, free market principles, entrepreneurial opportunity  
- **Heal**: Medical access, criminal justice reform, social healing
