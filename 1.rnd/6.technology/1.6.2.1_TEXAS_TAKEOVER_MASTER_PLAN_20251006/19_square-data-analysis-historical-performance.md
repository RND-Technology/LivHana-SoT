### SQUARE DATA ANALYSIS - HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE

**Required Data Pulls:**

```
Request for Jesse to provide or grant API access:

1. Sales by Month (all-time) → identify highest revenue month
2. Sales by Product (all-time) → identify best sellers
3. Sales by Customer (all-time) → identify VIP customers for re-engagement
4. Online vs In-Store Split → understand channel performance
5. Average Order Value by Channel
6. Repeat Customer Rate
7. Peak Sales Days/Times → optimize email send times
8. Seasonal Trends → identify high-demand periods
9. Customer Geography → refine targeting
10. Payment Method Preferences → optimize checkout options
```

**Hypothesis:** Based on typical cannabis retail patterns, highest month likely:

- April 2024 (4/20 holiday) or
- December 2024 (holiday gifting) or
- March 2024 (SXSW / spring break in Texas)

**Action:** Once highest month identified, reverse-engineer what drove that success:

- Promotions active?
- New product launches?
- External events (legislation, media coverage)?
- Marketing campaigns?
- Seasonal demand?

→ Replicate those conditions in October 2025.
