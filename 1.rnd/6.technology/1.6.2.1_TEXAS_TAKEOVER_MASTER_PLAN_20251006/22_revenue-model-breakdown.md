### REVENUE MODEL BREAKDOWN

**Target: $100K Net Sales**

**Assumptions:**

- Average Order Value (AOV): $75
- Conversion Rate: 3%
- Traffic Needed: ~44,500 visitors (to generate 1,333 orders at $75 each)
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): ~40% ($40K)
- Marketing Spend: ~10% ($10K)
- Operating Expenses: ~15% ($15K)
- Net Profit Margin: 35% = **$35K profit**

**To Hit $100K+ PROFIT (Not Just Revenue):**

- Need $285K in gross sales
- At $75 AOV = 3,800 orders
- At 3% conversion = 127,000 visitors

**Revised Strategy: Focus on Higher Profit Margin**

- Increase AOV to $100 (upsells, bundles, premium products)
- Improve conversion to 4% (via optimization above)
- Traffic: 42,000 visitors → 1,680 orders → $168K revenue
- At 60% gross margin: **$100K+ profit achievable**
