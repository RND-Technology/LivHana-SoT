### NOW (September 2025)

```
Living Trust (??)
└── R&D TX (Reggie & Dro LLC) [TX DSHS #690]
    ├── reggieanddro.com (main revenue)
    ├── Some operations under single entity
    └── Limited liability protection
```

**Issues:**

- ❌ All operations under one entity = single point of failure
- ❌ No interstate commerce structure (WY entity missing)
- ❌ No spin-off entities for IP protection
- ❌ Herbitrage not launched (revenue opportunity missed)
- ❌ Liv Hana AI not spun out (exit opportunity missed)
- ❌ Real estate mixed with operations (liability risk)
