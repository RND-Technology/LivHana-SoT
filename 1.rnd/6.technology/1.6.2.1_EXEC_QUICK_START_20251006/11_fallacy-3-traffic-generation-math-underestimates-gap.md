### ⚠️ **FALLACY #3: "Traffic Generation Math Underestimates Gap"**

**Claimed Traffic Sources:**

- Email: 1,250 visitors
- Social: 1,000 visitors
- Paid ads: 7,333 visitors
- Earned/PR: 6,000 visitors (OPTIMISTIC)
- Partner/influencer: 5,000 visitors (UNSUPPORTED)
**Total:** 20,583 visitors (NEED 42,000 for 4% conversion to hit 1,680 orders)

**Gap:** 21,417 visitors unaccounted for (51% of target)

**Resolution:**

1. Increase paid ad budget: $4K → $8-10K (double traffic to ~14,000 visitors)
2. Daily flash sales on Slickdeals, Reddit r/hempflowers (~5,000 visitors)
3. SMS campaign if phone list exists (~1,000 high-intent visitors)
4. Extend launch from 7 days → 14 days (accumulate traffic over time)

**Revised Target:** 35,000 visitors × 3% conversion × $85 AOV = $89,250 revenue → $31K profit (realistic)
