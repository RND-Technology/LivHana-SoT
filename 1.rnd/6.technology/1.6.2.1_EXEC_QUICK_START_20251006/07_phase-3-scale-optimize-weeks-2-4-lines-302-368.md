- Revenue: $15,000-18,750 (cumulative $28,125-33,750)
- Focus: Double down on winning campaigns, retarget abandoned carts

- Focus: Final push, Halloween promo, subscription pre-orders

**End of Month Reality Check:**

- **Conservative:** 1,200 orders × $75 AOV = $90K revenue → $29K profit (35% margin)
- **Aggressive:** 1,680 orders × $100 AOV = $168K revenue → $76K profit (60% margin after optimizations)

**To Hit $100K+ Profit:** Requires $285K revenue OR 60%+ margin on $168K revenue (via higher AOV + conversion improvements)
