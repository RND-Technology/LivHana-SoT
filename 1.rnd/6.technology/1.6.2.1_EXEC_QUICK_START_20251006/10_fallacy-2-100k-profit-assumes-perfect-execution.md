### ⚠️ **FALLACY #2: "$100K Profit Assumes Perfect Execution"**

**Claim:** 1,680 orders × $100 AOV = $168K revenue → $100K+ profit
**Reality Check:**

- **AOV $75 (current):** Requires 1,333 orders → $100K revenue
- **AOV $100 (optimistic):** Requires 1,000 orders → $100K revenue
- **Profit margin 35% (realistic):** $100K revenue → $35K profit (NOT $100K profit)
- **Profit margin 60% (aggressive):** Requires premium mix, no refunds, low CAC

**To Achieve $100K+ Profit:**

- Need $285K revenue @ 35% margin OR $168K revenue @ 60% margin
- Requires 2,850 orders @ $100 AOV OR 3,800 orders @ $75 AOV
- Current plan targets 1,200-1,500 orders → $29K-42K profit (realistic)

**Recommendation:** Revise goal to "$100K revenue + $35K+ profit" OR extend timeline to 60 days for $100K profit
