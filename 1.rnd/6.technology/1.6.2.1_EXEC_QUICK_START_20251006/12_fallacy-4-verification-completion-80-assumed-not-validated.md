### ⚠️ **FALLACY #4: "Verification Completion 80%+ Assumed, Not Validated"**

**Claim:** 80%+ customers will complete Veriff verification
**Reality:** No historical data on post-purchase verification flow

**Risk:** If completion rate = 50% → 50% refund rate → massive revenue loss + payment processor issues

**Mitigation:**

1. Simplify verification flow (1-click Veriff link, no manual uploads)
2. Incentivize completion (bonus 100 loyalty points = $10 off next order)
3. Phone support during business hours (hand-hold hesitant customers)
4. Track completion rate hourly Week 1, adjust email cadence if <70%

**Validation Required:** Run 10-20 test orders through full flow BEFORE launch, measure completion time + drop-off points
