### ðŸ”´ **FALLACY #1: "Day 4 Launch Possible"**

**Claim:** Day 0 today â†’ Day 4 launch (Monday)
**Reality:** Day 0 = infrastructure deployment start â†’ Day 2-3 = backend ready â†’ Day 5-6 = webstore ready â†’ Day 7-8 = launch

**Revised Timeline:**

- **Day 0 (Today):** Deploy voice-service + reasoning-gateway
- **Day 1:** Build backend verification API endpoints
- **Day 2:** Manual LightSpeed customizations (age-gate, hero, product pages)
- **Day 3:** SendGrid setup + email template loading
- **Day 4:** Final testing + pre-launch checklist
- **Day 5-6:** Buffer for bug fixes
- **Day 7 (LAUNCH):** Monday of Week 2 (realistic launch date)

**Impact:** Pushes entire campaign timeline back 1 week
**Mitigation:** Use extra week for deeper testing + better inventory prep
