### **Fallacy 2: Chicken-and-Egg Problem** ‚ùå

**Problem**: Need merchants before users install extension. Need users before merchants integrate.

**Reality Check**:

- Merchants won't integrate without proof of traffic
- Users won't install without proof of savings
- Cold-start problem = death spiral

**Fix**: **Start with Reggie & Dro as solo merchant** (self-serve). Prove unit economics with 100 R&D Members. Once validated, recruit external merchants with data: "We drove 100 sales at 80% conversion rate. Want in?"
