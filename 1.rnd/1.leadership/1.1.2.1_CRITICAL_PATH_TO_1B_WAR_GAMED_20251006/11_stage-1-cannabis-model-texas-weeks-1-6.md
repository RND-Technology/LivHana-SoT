### **STAGE 1: Cannabis Model (Texas) — Weeks 1-6**

**Goal**: Prove Liv Hana AI can recommend cannabis products better than Amazon algorithms.

**Execution**:

1. **Week 1: Launch Pilot Training Program**
   - Recruit 100 R&D Members (post in Reggie & Dro Facebook group, HNC community)
   - Selection criteria: 21+, Texas resident, cannabis consumer, tech-savvy
   - Incentive: Free LSS access + 10% discount + $10/feedback
   - Onboarding: Zoom call (Jesse explains program), install LSS, first purchase

2. **Week 2-3: Data Collection Sprint**
   - R&D Members use LSS on Reggie & Dro
   - Target: 400 purchases (100 members × 2 purchases × 2 weeks)
   - Feedback: Effect outcomes, COA preferences, satisfaction ratings
   - AI learns: Which cannabinoid/terpene profiles → which effects for which consumers

3. **Week 4: Recommendation Engine v1**
   - Train ML model on 400 data points
   - Deploy to LSS (now powered by real cannabis data)
   - Test: "Recommend a product for evening relaxation" → AI suggests Cheetah Piss (28% THCa, 1.8% myrcene)
   - Validate: 80%+ recommendation accuracy (member ratings 4-5 stars)

4. **Week 5-6: Economic Validation**
   - Track GMV: 100 members × 4 purchases/week × 6 weeks × $45 AOV = **$108K GMV**
   - Track recovered value: $108K × 15% recoverable = **$16.2K**
   - Track transaction fees: $108K × 3% = **$3.24K revenue**
   - Prove: $3.24K/6 weeks = **$540/week = $2,160/month** (from 100 users)
   - Extrapolate: 10K users = **$216K/month = $2.6M/year** (validates revenue model)

**Gate 1 (Week 6)**: If recommendation accuracy <75% OR revenue <$2K/month → PIVOT OR EXTEND.

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ 80%+ recommendation accuracy
- ✅ $2K+/month revenue (100 users)
- ✅ 400+ verified effect outcome data points
- ✅ Zero compliance violations
