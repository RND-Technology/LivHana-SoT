#### **Incentive Math (Per Member)**

**Costs**:

- Product discount: 10% of $45 avg = $4.50/purchase
- Feedback bonus: $10/purchase
- Total: $14.50/purchase × 2 purchases/week = $29/week = **$116/month per member**

**100 Members**:

- Monthly cost: 100 × $116 = **$11,600/month**
- Data collected: 100 × 8 purchases/month = **800 data points/month**
- Cost per data point: $11,600 / 800 = **$14.50/data point**

**Comparison**:

- Traditional data labeling: $50-100/hour, 5 data points/hour = **$10-20/data point**
- Synthetic data: $0 cost, but **useless** (AI hallucinates)
- Liv Hana: **$14.50/data point, REAL purchases, VERIFIED outcomes**

**ROI**:

- Month 1: -$11.6K (pure cost)
- Month 2: -$11.6K + $2.16K revenue (transaction fees) = -$9.44K
- Month 3: -$11.6K + $2.16K revenue = -$9.44K
- Month 4: Expand to 1,000 users (10× revenue, 2× cost) = **+$10K/month profit**
- Month 6: 10,000 users = **+$180K/month profit**

**Payback**: 4 months to breakeven, then compounding profit.
