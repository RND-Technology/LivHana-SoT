### **Fallacy 1: 48-Hour Timeline Unrealistic** ‚ùå

**Problem**: Building DID/PDV wallet + price crawler + RVS calculator + Chrome extension + merchant onboarding in 48 hours = heroic but high failure risk.

**Reality Check**:

- DID/PDV wallet: 1 week (if starting from scratch)
- Price crawler: 1 week (robust scraping + API integration)
- RVS calculator: 3 days (marketplace fee data + validation)
- Chrome extension: 1 week (UI + integration + testing)
- Merchant onboarding: 2 weeks (outreach + integration + legal)
**Realistic Timeline**: 3-4 weeks for stable POC

**Fix**: Staged rollout with **Pilot Training Program** (R&D members train AI while we build infrastructure).
