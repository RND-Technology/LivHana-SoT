### **Fallacy 4: Underestimating Compliance Complexity** ❌

**Problem**: Age gates, state-by-state regulations, COA validation = months of work, not days.

**Reality Check**:

- Age verification: Biometric ID integration (4-6 weeks)
- State regulations: 50-state legal research (ongoing)
- COA parsing: NIST validation (Texas COA Checker exists, but multi-state = 8-12 weeks)

**Fix**: **Start with general products (non-cannabis) for POC**. Prove LSS works on Amazon → Shopify for ANY product. Add cannabis in Month 2 once compliance infrastructure ready.

**Revised**: NO. Cannabis Model FIRST (moat advantage). Use existing Texas COA Checker. Start Texas-only. Expand states later.
