### **Fallacy 3: Missing Training Data Strategy** ❌

**Problem**: LSS needs cannabis-specific training data (effect outcomes, COA preferences, purchase patterns). Where does it come from?

**Reality Check**:

- Can't buy cannabis behavioral data (doesn't exist)
- Can't scrape it (illegal, unethical)
- Synthetic data = useless (AI hallucinates)

**Fix**: **LIV HANA PILOT TRAINING PROGRAM** (Jesse's breakthrough insight):

- Recruit 100 R&D Members (Texas-based, 21+, cannabis consumers)
- They use LSS to shop Reggie & Dro
- They provide detailed feedback after each purchase
- 100 members × 2 purchases/week = **200 data points/week = 800/month**
- Result: Proprietary training data that Google/Amazon can't replicate
