### **War Game 5: Cannabis Rescheduling Impacts Market** (Probability: 60%)

**Scenario**:

- Month 10: DEA reschedules cannabis to Schedule III
- Short-term chaos: Some states ban THCa (loophole closed), others legalize fully
- Reggie & Dro loses Texas market (THCa becomes Schedule III substance)

**Our Response**:

1. **Multi-State Hedge**: Already operating in 4 states (TX, OK, LA, NM); if TX falls, others remain
2. **Pivot to Full Legalization**: If rescheduling = broader legalization, expand to 20 states rapidly
3. **General Model Acceleration**: 50% revenue already from non-cannabis; become primary focus

**Kill Switch**: If cannabis revenue drops >75%, fully pivot to general e-commerce (LSS becomes "Amazon killer" with no cannabis).

**Probability We Survive**: 95% (regulatory changes create SHORT-term pain, LONG-term opportunity; we're positioned for both scenarios)
