### **Fallacy 7: Global Expansion Premature** ‚ùå

**Problem**: Talking about "Global Model" when we haven't validated Texas.

**Reality Check**:

- Different countries = different regulations (UK, EU, Canada)
- Different payment systems (no Mastercard Agent Pay in some regions)
- Different consumer behavior (trust levels, cashback expectations)

**Fix**: **Nail Cannabis Model in Texas FIRST**, then USA (general products), then Global (once both proven).
