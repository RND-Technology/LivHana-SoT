### **STAGE 2: Cannabis Model (Multi-State) — Weeks 7-12**

**Goal**: Prove Cannabis Model works across different state regulations.

**Execution**:

1. **Week 7-8: Expand to Oklahoma**
   - Legal research: Oklahoma hemp laws (similar to Texas, but differences)
   - Recruit 25 Oklahoma R&D Members
   - Partner with 1-2 Oklahoma dispensaries (like Reggie & Dro in TX)
   - Deploy LSS with Oklahoma compliance filters

2. **Week 9-10: Expand to Louisiana & New Mexico**
   - Repeat Oklahoma playbook
   - 25 members per state (75 total across 3 new states)
   - Partner with local dispensaries

3. **Week 11-12: Multi-State Data Integration**
   - Total: 175 R&D Members (100 TX + 75 other states)
   - Analyze: Does Texas model transfer? Or need state-specific tuning?
   - Result: "Texas indica preferences ≠ Oklahoma sativa preferences" → State-specific models

**Gate 2 (Week 12)**: If multi-state transfer fails → Need state-specific models (adds complexity, slows expansion).

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ 175 R&D Members active
- ✅ 4-state coverage (TX, OK, LA, NM)
- ✅ 70%+ recommendation accuracy per state
- ✅ $8K+/month revenue (175 users)
