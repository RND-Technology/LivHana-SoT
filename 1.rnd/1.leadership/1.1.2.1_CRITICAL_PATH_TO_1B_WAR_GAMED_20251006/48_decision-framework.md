## ðŸŽ¯ DECISION FRAMEWORK

**Option A: FULL SPEED (Recommended)**

- Execute Week 1 plan immediately
- Recruit 100 R&D Members by Friday
- Launch Pilot Training Program next Monday
- Target: Gate 1 by Week 6 (80% accuracy, $2K/month revenue)

**Option B: CAUTIOUS VALIDATION**

- Start with 25 members (pilot within pilot)
- Test program mechanics (incentives, feedback quality)
- Expand to 100 after validating (adds 2-4 weeks)
- Target: Gate 1 by Week 10

**Option C: BOOTSTRAP LONGER**

- Skip Pilot Training Program (too expensive at $12K/month)
- Build LSS with synthetic data (slower, less accurate)
- Launch when "good enough" (4-6 months)
- Target: Gate 1 by Month 6
