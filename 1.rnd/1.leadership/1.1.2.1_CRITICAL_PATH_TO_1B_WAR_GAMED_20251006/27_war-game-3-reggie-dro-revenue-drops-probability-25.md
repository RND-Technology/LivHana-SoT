### **War Game 3: Reggie & Dro Revenue Drops** (Probability: 25%)

**Scenario**:

- Month 3: LSS cannibalizes Reggie & Dro direct sales (customers wait for LSS recommendation instead of browsing)
- Net revenue: -10% (transaction fees don't offset lost margin)

**Our Response**:

1. **AOV Optimization**: LSS recommends bundles ("Buy 2 get free shipping")
2. **Upsell Logic**: "You bought Cheetah Piss, also try Grape Ape"
3. **Subscription Push**: Convert LSS users to Reggie & Dro membership (recurring revenue)

**Kill Switch**: If net revenue negative for 3 consecutive months, disable LSS on Reggie & Dro, focus on external merchants only.

**Probability We Recover**: 90% (upsell + bundles typically INCREASE AOV, not decrease)
