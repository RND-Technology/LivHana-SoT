### **Realistic Case (Probability: 35%)**

```
Month 6:
- Users: 10,000 (on target)
- Revenue: $42K/month (on target)
- Burn: $40K/month
- Runway: 15 months

Month 12:
- Users: 100,000
- Revenue: $500K/month ($6M ARR)
- Burn: $200K/month
- Series A: $10M at $50M valuation

Month 24:
- Users: 500,000
- Revenue: $5M/month ($60M ARR)
- Valuation: $60M × 12 (growth SaaS multiple) = $720M
- Result: Near-unicorn, need one more growth cycle

Month 30:
- Users: 1M
- Revenue: $10M/month ($120M ARR)
- Valuation: $120M × 10 = $1.2B
- Result: UNICORN (30 months, not 24)
```

**Key Insight**: $1B in 24 months requires EVERYTHING going right. 30 months is realistic with execution.
