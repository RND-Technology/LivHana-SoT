### **War Game 6: AI Model Accuracy Plateaus** (Probability: 35%)

**Scenario**:

- Month 4: Recommendation accuracy stuck at 70% (below 80% target)
- Members complain: "AI doesn't understand my preferences"
- Churn increases: 20% of Pilot members quit

**Our Response**:

1. **More Data**: Recruit 200 more members (double data volume)
2. **Better Features**: Add explicit preference inputs ("I prefer indica over sativa")
3. **Hybrid Model**: Combine AI recommendations with human curation (Jesse hand-picks top products)
4. **Lower Bar**: Redefine success as "70% accuracy = 3Ã— better than Amazon's 20-30% relevance"

**Kill Switch**: If accuracy <60% after 6 months, admit AI limitations, pivot to "expert-curated" model (Jesse as curator, AI as assistant).

**Probability We Recover**: 85% (more data + better features typically solve accuracy issues)
