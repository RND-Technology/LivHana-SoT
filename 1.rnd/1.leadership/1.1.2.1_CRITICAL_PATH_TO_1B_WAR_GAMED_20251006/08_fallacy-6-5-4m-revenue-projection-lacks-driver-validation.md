### **Fallacy 6: $5.4M Revenue Projection Lacks Driver Validation** ❌

**Problem**: We modeled subscriptions + transaction fees + data licensing, but haven't proven ANY of these work.

**Reality Check**:

- Subscriptions: Will users pay $9.99/mo for shopping assistant? (Unproven)
- Transaction fees: Will merchants pay 3% for unproven traffic? (Unproven)
- Data licensing: Will cultivators pay $3.5K/mo for insights? (Unproven)

**Fix**: **Validate ONE revenue stream (transaction fees) in pilot** before stacking others:

- Pilot: 100 R&D Members, 200 transactions/week, 3% fee
- Revenue: 200 × $45 AOV × 3% = $270/week = **$1,080/month**
- Once proven: Add subscriptions (Month 2), then data licensing (Month 4)
