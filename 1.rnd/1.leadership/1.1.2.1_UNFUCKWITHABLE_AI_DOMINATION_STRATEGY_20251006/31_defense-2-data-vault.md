### Defense 2: **Data Vault**

**Protect proprietary data**:

- Encrypt all member data (at rest + in transit)
- Backup to 3 locations (US, EU, Asia)
- Contractual protections (NDAs with all vendors)
- Access controls (only AI + 2 humans can access raw data)

**Why**: Data = unfuckwithable advantage. Protect it like nuclear codes.
