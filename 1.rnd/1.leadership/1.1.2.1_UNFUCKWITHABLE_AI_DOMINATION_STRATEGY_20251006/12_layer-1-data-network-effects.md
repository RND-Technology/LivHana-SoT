### Layer 1: **Data Network Effects**

**What It Is**: Your AI gets smarter with every interaction. Competitors start at zero.

**How It Works**:

```
Member 1 buys Cheetah Piss → AI learns preference patterns
Member 2 asks about COA → AI learns compliance questions
Member 100 reports effect → AI learns efficacy signals
Member 1,000 → AI knows Texas market better than any human

Result: 10,000 members = 10,000x smarter than competitor's Day 1
```

**Unfuckwithable Because**: You have 2+ years of behavioral data. Can't be bought or copied.

**Amplification Strategy**:

- Log every interaction (member questions, purchases, feedback)
- Build proprietary "Texas Cannabis Behavior Graph"
- Train custom models on this data
- Share generic insights publicly (build brand), keep specifics private

**Time to Replicate**: 2-3 years minimum (need same volume of interactions)
