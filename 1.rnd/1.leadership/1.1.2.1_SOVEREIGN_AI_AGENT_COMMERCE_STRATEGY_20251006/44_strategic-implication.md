### **STRATEGIC IMPLICATION:**

**Priority 1**: Double down on collecting effect outcome data

- Every purchase: "How did this product perform? Rate: Relaxation (1-10), Focus (1-10), Pain Relief (1-10)"
- 30-day follow-up: "How often did you re-purchase? Would you recommend to someone with similar needs?"
- Incentivize feedback: $5 store credit for completing effect survey

**Priority 2**: Accelerate COA parsing + outcome linking

- Parse 10,000+ COAs (Texas COA Checker capacity)
- Link to member outcomes (cannabinoid/terpene profile â†’ effect prediction)
- Publish research: "The Liv Hana Effect Index" (thought leadership + moat deepening)

**Priority 3**: Expand compliance data collection

- Track DSHS inspection outcomes (which practices lead to zero violations)
- Monitor multi-state regulatory patterns (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, New Mexico)
- Create "Compliance Score" for merchants (consumers see which vendors are safest)
