### **APEX INDEX FORMULA:**

```
Defensibility Score = (Uniqueness × Utility × Scalability) / (Replication Cost)

Where:
- Uniqueness: How hard is it for competitors to get this data? (1-10)
- Utility: How much does this data improve recommendations? (1-10)
- Scalability: Can this data improve with more users? (1-10)
- Replication Cost: How much would it cost competitor to acquire? ($1M-$100M+)
```
