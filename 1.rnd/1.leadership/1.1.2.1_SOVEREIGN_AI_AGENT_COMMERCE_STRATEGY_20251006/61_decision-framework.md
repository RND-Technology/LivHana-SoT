## üèÅ DECISION FRAMEWORK

**Option A: Full Commit (Recommended)**

- Build Liv Hana Agent as core product (not side project)
- Shift resources: 50% agent, 30% D2C (Reggie & Dro), 20% policy (OPS)
- Target: $5.4M revenue by Month 18
- **Upside**: Category leadership, $50M+ valuation by 2027
- **Downside**: High execution risk, requires sustained focus

**Option B: Parallel Track**

- Build Liv Hana Agent alongside existing business (D2C, OPS, HNC)
- Validate with MVA (Months 1-6), then decide full commit
- Target: $1M revenue by Month 18 (lower, but less risk)
- **Upside**: Optionality, less downside if market shifts
- **Downside**: Slower execution, competitors may beat us to market

**Option C: B2B Only**

- Skip consumer agent, sell technology to dispensaries/brands
- White-label "Powered by Liv Hana" agent for merchants
- Target: $2M revenue by Month 18 (data licensing + SaaS)
- **Upside**: Less consumer acquisition risk, faster revenue
- **Downside**: No consumer data moat, less defensible
