#### **Layer 3: Intent Prediction & Recommendation Engine**

**How It Works:**

```
Consumer input: "I need something for sleep, but my tolerance is high"

AI analysis:
- User history: Prefers indica-dominant, high THCa (25%+)
- Last 3 purchases: Cheetah Piss, Grape Ape, Purple Punch
- Terpene preference: High myrcene (sedative effect)
- Budget: Willing to pay premium for quality
- Compliance: Requires full panel testing (no pesticides)

Recommendation logic:
1. Filter: Only indica-dominant, THCa >25%, myrcene >1%, full panel COA
2. Compare: 15 products across 8 vendors match criteria
3. Rank: By price per THCa mg + terpene profile fit + user reviews
4. Present: Top 3 options with reasoning

Output:
"Based on your preferences, I recommend:
1. Grape Valley Kush (29% THCa, 1.8% myrcene) - $50/eighth at Vendor X
2. Midnight Express (27% THCa, 1.5% myrcene) - $45/eighth at Reggie & Dro (in stock)
3. Purple Sunset (26% THCa, 1.6% myrcene) - $42/eighth at Vendor Y (ships tomorrow)

Why #2 (Midnight Express): In stock now, trusted source (Reggie & Dro), slightly lower THCa but better terpene profile match, $5 cheaper than #1, full panel COA shows zero pesticides."
```

**Key Features:**

- Transparent reasoning (consumer sees why AI recommends X over Y)
- Multi-vendor comparison (not locked to Reggie & Dro only)
- Fiduciary duty (recommends best for consumer, even if lower margin)
- Compliance-first (never recommends sketchy products)

**Competitive Moat**: Domain-specific recommendation logic; ChatGPT can't do this (no cannabis knowledge).
