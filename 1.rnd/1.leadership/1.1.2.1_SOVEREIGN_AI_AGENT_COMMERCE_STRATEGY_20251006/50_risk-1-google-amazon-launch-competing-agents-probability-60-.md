### **Risk 1: Google/Amazon Launch Competing Agents (Probability: 60%, Impact: High)**

**Scenario**: Google launches "Google Shopping Agent" that also compares prices across sites.

**Why They'll Struggle:**

- **No cannabis data**: Google/Amazon legally restricted from cannabis commerce (federal illegality)
- **General vs. specific**: Their agents optimize for general e-commerce; Liv Hana optimizes for cannabis compliance + effects
- **Consumer trust**: Cannabis consumers distrust big tech (privacy concerns, data harvesting)
- **Regulatory risk**: Google/Amazon won't risk brand on THC products

**Mitigation**:

- **Deepen moat**: Focus on effect outcome data (Google can't get this without verified purchases)
- **State-by-state compliance**: Build regulatory expertise they can't replicate quickly
- **Consumer sovereignty positioning**: "We serve YOU, not advertisers" (contrast with Google's ad-driven model)

**Kill Switch**: If Google/Amazon enter cannabis AI, shift to B2B (white-label for dispensaries) and data licensing (they'll need our data).
