#### **Layer 2: Real-Time Product Intelligence Engine**

**What It Does:**

- Crawls ALL cannabis e-commerce sites (not just Reggie & Dro)
- Parses COAs automatically (Texas COA Checker integration)
- Monitors prices in real-time (dynamic pricing across 100+ sites)
- Tracks inventory (batch drops, limited releases)
- Analyzes reviews (member reports of effects, quality)
- Validates compliance (DSHS-compliant vs. sketchy sources)

**Data Sources:**

- Reggie & Dro (proprietary)
- LightSpeed POS (inventory data)
- Square API (transaction data)
- KCA Labs (COA database)
- Public dispensary sites (scraped data)
- Member reviews (verified purchase data)

**Update Frequency**: Real-time (prices, inventory) + daily (COAs, reviews)

**Competitive Moat**: Cannabis-specific crawling infrastructure; general AI agents don't have this.
