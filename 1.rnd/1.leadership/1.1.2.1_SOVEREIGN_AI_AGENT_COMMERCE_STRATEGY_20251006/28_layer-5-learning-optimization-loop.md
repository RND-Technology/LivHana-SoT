#### **Layer 5: Learning & Optimization Loop**

**What It Does:**

- Analyzes every purchase outcome (did consumer like it? effects match prediction?)
- Updates consumer profile (refines preferences over time)
- Improves recommendation model (learns which factors matter most)
- Identifies new products (batch drops, new strains)
- Predicts future needs ("You typically re-order every 14 days; I see a new batch dropping Friday that matches your preferences")

**Key Metric**: Recommendation accuracy (% of purchases consumer rates 4-5 stars)

**Target**: 90%+ accuracy by Month 6 (vs. 60-70% for general e-commerce recommendations)

**Competitive Moat**: This gets better with every purchase; Amazon's 10-year head start in general e-commerce doesn't transfer to cannabis.
