### **Risk 2: Regulatory Crackdown on AI Agents (Probability: 30%, Impact: Medium)**

**Scenario**: FTC or state regulators restrict AI agents from making autonomous purchases (consumer protection concerns).

**Mitigation**:

- **Consumer approval required**: All autonomous transactions require pre-approval (budget limits, product constraints)
- **Transparency**: Show AI's reasoning for every recommendation (explainable AI)
- **Fiduciary duty**: Position as consumer's agent (legally defensible if we act in consumer's interest)
- **Compliance-first**: Work with regulators proactively (don't wait for enforcement)

**Kill Switch**: If autonomous checkout banned, revert to recommendation-only mode (still valuable, but lower conversion).
