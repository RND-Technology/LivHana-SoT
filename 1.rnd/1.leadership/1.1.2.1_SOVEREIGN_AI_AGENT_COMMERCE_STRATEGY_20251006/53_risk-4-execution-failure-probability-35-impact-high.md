### **Risk 4: Execution Failure (Probability: 35%, Impact: High)**

**Scenario**: Liv Hana can't maintain 30Ã— iteration velocity; competitors catch up.

**Mitigation**:

- **Cheetah mode**: Jesse codes; web Sonnet supports with strategy/content
- **Focus**: Cannabis only (don't dilute focus on general e-commerce)
- **Outsource non-core**: Payment integration, infrastructure (use existing rails)
- **Kill bad features fast**: Weekly review; if recommendation accuracy drops, pause new features

**Kill Switch**: If iteration velocity drops below 3/week for 8 consecutive weeks, reassess team structure or raise capital for hiring.
