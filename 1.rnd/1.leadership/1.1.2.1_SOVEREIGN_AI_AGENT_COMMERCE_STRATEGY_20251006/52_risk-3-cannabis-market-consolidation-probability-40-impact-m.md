### **Risk 3: Cannabis Market Consolidation (Probability: 40%, Impact: Medium)**

**Scenario**: Large MSOs (Curaleaf, Trulieve) vertically integrate and refuse to share data with Liv Hana.

**Mitigation**:

- **Multi-vendor strategy**: Don't depend on any single merchant (crawl public data)
- **Direct-to-consumer focus**: Work with independent cultivators/brands (they NEED our distribution)
- **Consumer leverage**: If MSOs block us, consumers boycott (we own consumer relationship)
- **B2B pivot**: License technology TO MSOs (if you can't beat them, sell them shovels)

**Kill Switch**: If MSOs block access, shift to B2B licensing model (they'll pay to access our consumer base).
