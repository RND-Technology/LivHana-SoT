#### **Stream 3: Affiliate Marketing ($17B+/year)**

**Traditional Model:**

```
Consumer reads review blog
→ Clicks affiliate link
→ Buys product
→ Merchant pays affiliate 5-30% commission
→ Consumer doesn't benefit (often higher prices to cover affiliate cut)
```

**AI Agent Model:**

```
AI acts as consumer's buying agent (fiduciary duty to consumer)
→ AI finds best price regardless of affiliate relationships
→ AI negotiates on consumer's behalf
→ Consumer saves money, affiliate earns nothing
```

**Value Capture Opportunity:** $17B affiliate market × 50% replaced by AI agents = **$8.5B/year**
