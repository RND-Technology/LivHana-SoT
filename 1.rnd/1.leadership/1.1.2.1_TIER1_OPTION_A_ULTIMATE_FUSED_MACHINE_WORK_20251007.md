## 🚀 CURRENT SPRINT: NASH DOMINATION + SATX TAKEOVER

### TIER 1 PRIORITY: Delivery Service Launch (30 Minutes)

**Status:** BLOCKED - Waiting for Jesse's API keys
**Timeline:** Launch TODAY once API keys obtained

**Human Work Required (Jesse):**
1. Get DoorDash API key - https://merchant.doordash.com/ (15 min)
2. Get Uber Eats API key - https://merchants.ubereats.com/ (15 min)
3. Add keys to .env file (1 min)
4. Run `./deploy.sh` (5 min)

**Machine Work Complete:**

- ✅ Multi-provider failover (DoorDash → Uber automatic)
- ✅ Dockerfile ready
- ✅ deploy.sh ready
- ✅ Documentation complete (README.md, LAUNCH_TODAY.md)
- ✅ Bad $80K plan fixed → $0 plan

**Economic Impact:**
- Save $5-7 per $75 order vs Nash
- NO driver hiring needed (use Nash's outsourcing model)
- Launch cost: $0 (just API keys)

---

## 🏪 SATX MARKET DOMINATION STRATEGY

### Competitor Analysis (8 Shops Identified)

**Rank 1: Canniversal CBD & THC**
- Location: Multiple locations
- Strength: Premium quality + variety
- Weakness: Higher pricing
- **Our Advantage:** Social club + free product testing

**Rank 2: The Farmacy Botanical Shoppe**
- Location: Delivery-only
- Strength: Same-day delivery + $10/g pricing
- Weakness: No physical presence
- **Our Advantage:** Physical lounge + community

**Rank 3: Kiefs Dispensary**
- Location: 442 Bandera Rd, San Antonio, TX 78228
- Strength: Great vibes + curated selection
- Weakness: Limited delivery
- **Our Advantage:** Full delivery integration

**Rank 4: Reggie & Dro (US)**
- Location: Central San Antonio
- Strength: Members-only social club
- Opportunity: Beat Nash delivery, expand reach
- **Target:** Dominate with superior delivery + content

**Rank 5: HighWay San Antonio**
- Location: Delivery-focused
- Strength: Same-day delivery
- Weakness: Commodity service
- **Our Advantage:** Community + content engine

**Gaps We Fill:**
1. ✅ Social club with onsite consumption (unique in SATX)
2. ✅ Direct delivery integration (beat Nash costs)
3. ✅ Content-driven acquisition (HNC Auto-Toon engine)
4. ✅ Free product testing (11,000+ members)

**Jesse's Directive:**
> "Reverse engineer how each competitor is above R&D in SATX... architect, out-engineer and verify superior strategies to TAKEOVER SATX THCA MARKET ASAP"

## 💎 UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE DISCOVERED: "DON'T BUILD WHAT EXISTS"

### The Nash Lesson (Oct 7, 2025)

**Bad Plan (REJECTED by Jesse):**
- $80K investment
- 12-week timeline
- Complex "white-label setup"
- Made it sound like hiring drivers

**Jesse's Feedback:**
> "1,000X improve this shit plan you proposed: $75K investment and 10-week timeline"

**Good Plan (APPROVED):**
- $0 investment
- 30-minute timeline
- Use Nash's model: Outsource drivers via DoorDash/Uber API
- Just get 2 API keys and launch

**Universal Pattern:**
```
DON'T BUILD:         USE EXISTING:        FILL THE GAP:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Driver fleet    →    DoorDash/Uber    →   Skip Square intermediary
Custom voice    →    ElevenLabs API   →   Add queue management
Custom video    →    D-ID + DALL-E    →   Add production pipeline
Custom analytics →   Google Analytics →   Add TPOP weighting
```

**Applied Across All Projects:**
- ✅ Delivery: Use existing APIs, skip intermediary, save $5-7/order
- ✅ Voice: Use existing APIs, add queue architecture
- ✅ Content: Use existing APIs, add production automation
- ✅ Age verification: Find existing API (don't build custom)
- ✅ Payment: Integrate Stripe/Square (don't build custom)
