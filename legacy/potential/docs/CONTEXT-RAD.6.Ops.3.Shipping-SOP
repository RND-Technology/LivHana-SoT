# R&D.6.Ops.3.Shipping SOP - Context Dragnet & Version Control Framework

## **ULTIMATE RESULT**
Deploy unified **R&D.6.Ops.3.Shipping SOP v0** through Replit Agent3 integration with full version control, audit trail, and operational continuity.

## **ULTIMATE PURPOSE** 
Consolidate all shipping operations into single source of truth, enabling seamless handoff to Replit Agent3 for automated execution while maintaining compliance and scalability.

## **PHASE 1: CONTEXT DRAGNET EXECUTION**

### **1.1 Current State Audit**
**Action Block Week 1:**
- [ ] **Inventory existing shipping documentation**
  - Square shipping workflows
  - UPS automation scripts  
  - Inventory management protocols
  - Compliance documentation
  - Team training materials

- [ ] **Map current shipping touchpoints**
  - Order processing → fulfillment pipeline
  - Inventory allocation → shipping preparation  
  - Carrier selection → tracking handoff
  - Customer communication → delivery confirmation

- [ ] **Document knowledge holders**
  - Jesse's tribal knowledge capture
  - Team member specializations
  - Vendor integration points
  - Customer feedback loops

### **1.2 Process Archaeology**
**Action Block Week 2:**
- [ ] **Screen record all manual processes**
- [ ] **Interview each team member on shipping workflows**
- [ ] **Capture exception handling procedures**
- [ ] **Document seasonal/peak period adaptations**

### **2.2 Change Management Protocol**
**RPM Framework Application:**
- **Result:** Every change tracked, approved, deployed with rollback capability
- **Purpose:** Maintain operational continuity while enabling continuous improvement
- **Massive Action Plan:**
  1. Change request → Impact assessment → Stakeholder approval
  2. Staging environment testing → Validation checklist completion
  3. Production deployment → Performance monitoring → Documentation update

## **PHASE 3: REPLIT AGENT3 INTEGRATION PREP**

### **3.1 API Specification Documentation**
- [ ] **Square POS integration requirements**
- [ ] **UPS shipping API endpoints**
- [ ] **Inventory management system hooks**
- [ ] **Customer notification triggers**

### **3.2 Automation Decision Trees**
- [ ] **Order routing logic** (product type, destination, priority)
- [ ] **Carrier selection algorithms** (cost, speed, reliability matrix)
- [ ] **Exception handling workflows** (out-of-stock, shipping delays, customer changes)
- [ ] **Compliance validation checkpoints** (age verification, regulatory requirements)

## **PHASE 4: CONTEXT CONSOLIDATION**

### **4.1 Master SOP Creation**
**Single Source Document Structure:**
1. **Executive Summary** (1-page overview for Jesse)
2. **Process Flow Diagrams** (visual workflows)
3. **Step-by-Step Procedures** (team execution guide)
4. **Integration Specifications** (Replit Agent3 handoff)
5. **Compliance Matrix** (regulatory requirements)
6. **Performance Metrics** (KPIs and monitoring)
7. **Training Protocols** (onboarding and updates)
8. **Emergency Procedures** (system failures, peak loads)

### **4.2 Knowledge Transfer Protocol**
- [ ] **Video walkthrough creation** (Jesse's knowledge capture)
- [ ] **Interactive training modules** (team certification)
- [ ] **Integration testing scripts** (Replit Agent3 validation)
- [ ] **Performance baseline establishment** (pre-automation metrics)

---

## **IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE**

**Week 1-2:** Context Dragnet + Current State Documentation  
**Week 3-4:** Version Control Setup + Integration Prep  
**Week 5-6:** Master SOP Creation + Replit Agent3 Configuration  
**Week 7-8:** Testing, Validation + Go-Live Preparation  

---

## **SUCCESS METRICS**
- **Documentation Completeness:** 100% of shipping processes documented
- **Integration Readiness:** All API specifications validated with Replit Agent3
- **Team Adoption:** 100% team certification on new SOP
- **Performance Maintenance:** Zero degradation in shipping metrics during transition
- **Version Control Compliance:** All changes tracked with audit trail

---

**NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Initiate context dragnet audit of current shipping documentation and schedule knowledge capture sessions with Jesse and team.

**Risk Mitigation:** Maintain parallel operations during transition with rollback procedures at every integration checkpoint.
