# Potential Archive

Files copied from the legacy `LivHana-Potential` workspace.

- `docs/` – all historical prompts, ADRs, and exports (duplicate content lives in `../docs/`).
- `logs/` – automation run logs (builds, ingestion reports, etc.).
- `n8n/` – empty runtime folders plus stored credentials file.

Reference only; do not revive automation here.
