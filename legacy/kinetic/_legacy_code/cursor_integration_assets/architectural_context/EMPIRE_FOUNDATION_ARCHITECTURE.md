### EMPIRE FOUNDATION ARCHITECTURE

Purpose: Establish a cohesive, compliant, scalable foundation for cannabis intelligence systems.

Domains:
- Product Intelligence: Strain analytics, COA validation, quality scoring
- Revenue Systems: Pricing, tax, POS integrations, profitability analytics
- Compliance: 21+ verification, audit trails, reporting, COA provenance
- Agent Swarm: Retrieval, planning, execution with veteran oversight
- Platform: Identity, observability, data, security, and deployment

Core Tenets:
- Local-first AI (DeepSeek V3.1), deterministic deployments, strong isolation
- Event-driven data flows with idempotent processing and immutable logs
- Principle of Least Privilege, zero-trust networking, explicit egress controls

High-Level Components:
- API Gateway: Auth, rate limiting, schema validation
- Services: analytics, compliance, revenue, voice, testimony
- Data Layer: AlloyDB (OLTP), BigQuery/Parquet lakehouse (OLAP), GCS
- Observability: Prometheus + Grafana, OpenTelemetry, audit log sinks
- Security: KMS, Secret Manager, Vault (optional), DLP redaction

SLAs/SLOs:
- APIs: p95 < 200ms, 99.9% uptime, error rate < 0.1%
- Coordination: < 100ms agent handshake latency
- Data: < 1h end-to-end freshness for BI

Interfaces:
- gRPC/REST with protobuf/OpenAPI, JSON:API for external partners
- Async via Pub/Sub or Kafka; dead-letter queues, replayable topics

Change Management:
- Infra-as-code (Terraform), GitOps, migration scripts, blue/green deploys

Risk Controls:
- Rollback runbooks, chaos drills, backup/restore tests, key rotation cadence
