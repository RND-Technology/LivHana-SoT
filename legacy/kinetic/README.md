# Kinetic Archive

Snapshot of assets migrated from the legacy `LivHana-Kinetic` repository. These files remain for historical or reference purposes only.

Key items:
- `_legacy_code/` – early orchestrators, Docker setups, integration specs.
- `web_empire/` – legacy web automation scripts.
- Empty scaffolding directories (`agents/`, `engines/`, `tools/`) kept with `.gitkeep` placeholders.
