## FAQ

**Q: What if I can't identify 22 ads to pause?**
A: Pause whatever meets the criteria (efficiency <1.0). Even pausing 10-15 will free up $1,000-1,500/month.

**Q: What if Purple Theme is already at $1,200/month?**
A: Great! Focus on scaling Orange Character and Red/Orange instead. Use saved budget for testing new variations.

**Q: How do I know which ads are "Purple Theme" vs "Orange Character"?**
A: Look at the ad creative/thumbnail in Meta Ads Manager. Purple Theme = predominant purple background/elements. Orange Character = features the HNC character in orange.

**Q: What if I don't have $5,905 budget available?**
A: Start with what you have. Scale winners proportionally. Example: If you only have $3,000 total, allocate 32% to Purple, 41% to Orange, 27% to Red/Orange.

**Q: Should I pause ads immediately or gradually?**
A: Immediate. Low-performing ads won't suddenly improve. Every day they run costs you $76.50 ($2,295 ÷ 30 days).

**Q: How fast should I scale winners?**
A: Increase budget by 20% every 3 days if ROAS stays above 2.5. Don't increase more than 50% in a single week to avoid audience fatigue.

**Q: What's the #1 thing that could go wrong?**
A: Scaling too fast and hitting ad fatigue. Solution: Have 3-5 variations of each winner ready to rotate every 2 weeks.
