He wears a button-down shirt (sleeves rolled to elbows) in sage green or dusty blue, dark denim jeans. Strong jawline, intelligent brown eyes, slight smile showing confidence but approachable. Clean bold cartoon style with thick black outlines, simplified geometric shapes, flat colors with minimal shading. Head and shoulders composition (portrait crop). Solid warm background (terracotta or sandy beige). Professional educational animation style, mobile-optimized, clear facial features for D-ID animation. 4K quality, high detail.
