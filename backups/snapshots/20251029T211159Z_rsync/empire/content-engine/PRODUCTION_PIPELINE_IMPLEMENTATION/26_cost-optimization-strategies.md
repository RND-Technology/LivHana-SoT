### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Asset Caching:**
   - Character images: Reuse across all episodes (~$0.20 saved per episode)
   - Background scenes: Reuse common locations (~$0.12 saved per episode)
   - Potential savings: 17% per episode

2. **Batch Processing:**
   - Generate all character images once upfront
   - Generate common backgrounds once upfront
   - Use standard quality instead of HD for backgrounds

3. **Parallel Production:**
   - Risk: May hit rate limits requiring retries
   - Benefit: Faster overall completion
