### 80-20 Rule for Cannabis Content

**The Formula**: 80% educational/entertaining, 20% brand

**80% Content**:

- Compliance education
- Industry news
- Business tips
- Comedy/satire
- Community stories

**20% Content**:

- About HNC
- Follow CTAs
- Merchandise (if any)
- Newsletter signups
- Community events

**Why This Matters**: Platforms penalize overly promotional content. Educational content gets algorithm favor.
