#### The 3-Second Rule

**Why It Matters**:

- Average user decides to scroll in under 3 seconds
- Algorithms track "Viewed vs. Swiped Away"
- First frame is your only guaranteed impression

**Hook Strategies**:

1. **Pattern Interrupt**
   - Unexpected visual (character falling, explosion)
   - Surprising statement
   - Jarring sound effect
   - Contrast from typical feed content

2. **Curiosity Gap**
   - "You won't believe what happens when..."
   - "The [number] mistake that..."
   - "This [thing] changed everything..."
   - Incomplete information that demands resolution

3. **Relatability**
   - "POV: You're a hemp business owner and..."
   - "When you realize [common situation]..."
   - "Tell me you work in cannabis without telling me..."
   - Immediate identification with viewer

4. **Value Proposition**
   - "Here's what you need to know about..."
   - "Save [time/money] with this compliance tip"
   - "The [number] steps to..."
   - Clear benefit statement

5. **Question Hook**
   - "Did you know [surprising fact]?"
   - "What would you do if [scenario]?"
   - "Is [common practice] actually illegal in Texas?"
   - Engages curiosity response

**HNC Hook Formula**:

```
[Visual: Character in action]
+ [Text overlay: Question or statement]
+ [Narration: Hook line]
+ [Music sting or sound effect]
= First 3 seconds
```

**Example Hooks for HNC**:

1. "Wait... THIS is illegal in Texas?!" [Character shocked face]
2. "This compliance mistake cost $50,000" [Money flying away animation]
3. "Texas hemp owners: Stop doing this NOW" [Warning visual]
4. "POV: HHSC inspector walks into your business" [Door opening dramatically]
5. "3 things every hemp business gets wrong" [Number countdown]
