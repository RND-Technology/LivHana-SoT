#### Algorithm Optimization (2025)

**Key Algorithm Mechanics**:

- Two reach types: Connected (followers) vs. Unconnected (non-followers)
- Top 3 signals: Watch time, Likes, DM Shares
- Original, high-quality content prioritized
- Watermarked/repurposed videos get penalized

**Critical Success Metrics**:

1. **Watch Time**: Complete video views
2. **DM Shares**: The highest-weighted engagement
3. **Saves**: Indicates high-value content
4. **Replays**: Auto-loop or manual replay

**Optimal Video Length**:

- 7-15 seconds performs best
- Under 30 seconds recommended for HNC
- Design for smooth looping

**Optimization Tactics for HNC**:

2. **Watch Time Optimization**
