3. Open dashboard in browser
4. Begin continuous monitoring

### Stop Monitoring

```bash
cd empire/content-engine
./stop-monitoring.sh
```

### Manual Commands

```bash
# Single system scan

The system automatically adjusts these parameters based on analysis:

**Current Settings** (`output/auto-adjustment-params.json`):

```json
{
  "humorDensity": 1.2,           // Increased by 20%
  "advocacyStrength": 1.15,      // Increased by 15%
  "texasReferences": 1.0,        // Baseline
  "catchphraseFrequency": 1.3,   // Increased by 30%
  "targetLength": 120,           // Seconds
  "personaPriority": [           // Ranked by potential
    "Gen Z Short-Form Consumers",
    "Federal Legalization Advocates",
    "Texas Cannabis Users",
    "Trump Supporters (Cannabis)"
  ]
}
```

## ALERT LEVELS

| Level | Description | Example | Action |
|-------|-------------|---------|--------|
| INFO | Normal operations | System started | None |
| WARNING | Attention needed | No recent episodes | Check pipeline |
| ERROR | Action required | Generation failed | Investigate logs |
| CRITICAL | Immediate action | System failure | Restart services |

---

## INTEGRATION WITH CONTENT ENGINE

The monitoring system feeds learnings back automatically:

1. **Improvement Loop** analyzes episodes every 30 minutes
2. Generates `auto-adjustment-params.json`
3. Content engine reads parameters on next run
4. Adjusts humor, advocacy, persona targeting
5. Produces improved episodes
6. Loop continues, system gets smarter

**Result**: Self-optimizing content generation

---

## TESTING PERFORMED

- ✓ System monitor scans all systems correctly
- ✓ Improvement loop analyzes episodes successfully
- ✓ Status reports generated in JSON format
- ✓ Latest status file updated correctly
- ✓ LEARNINGS.md generated with insights
- ✓ Quality metrics saved properly
- ✓ Auto-adjustment parameters calculated
- ✓ Alert logging functional
- ✓ Scripts executable and working
- ✓ Dashboard HTML opens in browser

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Dashboard not showing data?

- Check `reports/autonomous-status/latest-status.json` exists
- Verify monitor ran at least once: `./monitor-all-systems.mjs once`

### Services not running?

```bash
ps aux | grep monitor-all-systems
ps aux | grep continuous-improvement
```

### View logs

```bash
tail -f reports/autonomous-status/monitor.log
tail -f reports/autonomous-status/improvement.log
tail -f reports/autonomous-status/ALERTS.log
```

### Reset everything

```bash
./stop-monitoring.sh
rm reports/autonomous-status/*.pid
./launch-monitoring.sh
```

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Launch monitoring system**:

   ```bash
   cd empire/content-engine
   ./launch-monitoring.sh
   ```

2. **Generate more episodes** with proper content to train the system

3. **Monitor dashboard** for real-time updates

4. **Review LEARNINGS.md** daily for insights

5. **Act on recommendations** to improve quality scores

6. **Scale up production** once scores are consistently 8.5+

---

---

## SCALING RECOMMENDATIONS

For high-volume production (100+ episodes/day):

1. Increase monitoring frequency (1-minute intervals)
2. Archive old reports (> 30 days) to database
3. Implement distributed monitoring (multiple nodes)
4. Add real-time websocket updates to dashboard
5. Set up external alerting (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
6. Add API endpoints for programmatic access
