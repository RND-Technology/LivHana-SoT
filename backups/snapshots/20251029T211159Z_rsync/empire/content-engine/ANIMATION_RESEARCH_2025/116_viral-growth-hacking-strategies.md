### Viral Growth Hacking Strategies

**Content Calendar Optimization:**

- **Monday:** Legal compliance tips (high engagement start of week)
- **Wednesday:** Grower education (mid-week educational content)
- **Friday:** Satirical/comedic take on week's cannabis news (entertainment for weekend)

**Hook Formulas (First 3 Seconds):**

1. "You won't believe what California just banned..."
2. "Getting fired for legal cannabis? Here's the truth..."
3. "This compliance mistake costs $50,000..."

**Engagement Triggers:**

- End each video with question: "Have you experienced this? Comment below!"
- Use polls in TikTok/Instagram versions
- Pin controversial (but accurate) comment to drive discussion

**Cross-Platform Strategy:**

```
TikTok: 15-second comedic version
YouTube Shorts: 60-second educational deep-dive
Instagram Reels: 30-second visual-heavy version
LinkedIn: 90-second professional compliance focus
```

Each platform gets optimized content, not same video everywhere.
