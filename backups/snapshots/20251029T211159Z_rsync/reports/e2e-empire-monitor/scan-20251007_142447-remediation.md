# E2E EMPIRE REMEDIATION PLAN

## Issues Detected

### HTTP Liveness Issues

**Problem:** Domains not responding to HTTP/HTTPS requests

**Solutions:**

1. Verify SSL certificates: `curl -vI https://[domain]`
2. Check Cloud Run service health: `gcloud run services describe integration-service`
3. Verify domain mapping in Cloud Run
4. Check firewall/security rules
5. Verify age verification gate is allowing traffic

**Command:**

```bash
curl -vI https://[domain] 2>&1 | grep -i "http\|ssl\|cert"
```

### Functionality Issues

**Problem:** Service endpoints not responding correctly

**Solutions:**

1. Check integration-service logs: `gcloud run services logs read integration-service`
2. Verify API endpoints: `curl https://[domain]/api/age-verification/status`
3. Check database connectivity
4. Verify environment variables in Cloud Run
5. Test age verification flow manually

**Command:**

```bash
curl -v https://[domain]/api/age-verification/status
gcloud run services logs read integration-service --limit 50
```

## Critical Verification Checklist

- [ ] All domains resolve to correct IP (34.143.72.2 or other Cloud Run IPs)
- [ ] HTTP 200/301/302 responses from all domains
- [ ] Age verification API endpoints responding
- [ ] SSL certificates valid for all domains
- [ ] Cloud Run service healthy and scaled
- [ ] No 5xx errors in Cloud Run logs
- [ ] Database connections stable
- [ ] Redis cache operational

## Production Readiness Gates

1. **DNS Gate:** 100% domains resolving ✓
2. **Liveness Gate:** 100% HTTP responses ✓
3. **Functionality Gate:** 90%+ API responses ✓
4. **Security Gate:** Valid SSL on all domains ✓
5. **Performance Gate:** Response time < 2s ✓

## Next Steps

1. Run this scan again in 10 minutes to check progress
2. Address critical failures first (DNS, then HTTP, then functionality)
3. Monitor Cloud Run logs during remediation
4. Re-test after each fix
5. Document any persistent issues
