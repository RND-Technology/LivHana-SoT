- Establish track order for optimal flow
- Finalize masters (audio quality check)
- Create cover art (AI + design tools)
- Prepare metadata (titles, artist info, rights)
- Set up distribution (streaming platforms)
- Build marketing plan (launch strategy)

### **SUCCESS METRICS**
- 12-20 album-ready tracks selected from 386
- Each track passes 10X Jarvis quality threshold (score 7+/10)
- Album themes coherent and compelling (validated by team)
- Release assets complete and ready for distribution

### **DEPENDENCIES**
- 10X Jarvis framework operational
- Suno account access maintained
- Distribution platform accounts set up

## ðŸŸ¡ PRIORITY 3: CONTENT AUTOMATION PIPELINE EXPANSION

### **WHAT**
Scale Blazed Fest content automation model to all content sources

### **WHY**
- Blazed Fest pipeline PROVEN: capture â†’ Drive â†’ YouTube â†’ Slack in <1 hour
- Manual content publishing bottleneck eliminated
- Ready to scale to HNC, podcasts, training videos, interviews
- Zero-touch publishing = massive velocity unlock

### **CURRENT STATE (PROVEN)**
**Blazed Fest Pipeline:**
- Content captured live in ATX
- Auto-scraped to Drive within 1 hour
- Auto-upload to YouTube
- Auto-delivery to Slack when complete
- END-TO-END AUTOMATION âœ…

### **EXPANSION PLAN**

**Additional Content Sources:**
1. HNC recordings (60-120s daily episodes)
2. Podcast sessions (long-form interviews)
3. Training videos (team tutorials)
4. Event recordings (conferences, workshops)
5. Interviews (media, partners, thought leaders)

**Smart Routing Architecture:**
- Auto-categorize content by type (video, audio, text)
- Route to appropriate channels (YouTube, Spotify, website, social)
- Tag and index for searchability
- Create thumbnails and metadata automatically

**Multi-Platform Distribution:**
- YouTube (video primary)
- Spotify (audio podcasts)
