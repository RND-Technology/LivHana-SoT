Pasted-Top-THCA-Shops-in-San-Antonio-TX-Based-on-recent-online-reviews-Reddit-discussions-and-local-list-1759854432608_1759854432608.txt
Top THCA Shops in San Antonio, TX
Based on recent online reviews, Reddit discussions, and local listings (as of October 2025), here’s a curated list of the top-rated THCA shops in San Antonio. These focus on high-quality, legal hemp-derived THCA products like flower, vapes, and edibles. Rankings consider customer feedback on product potency, authenticity, service, and delivery options. Note: THCA is federally legal under the 2018 Farm Bill if under 0.3% Delta-9 THC, but always verify local regs and age restrictions (21+). Prices and availability can vary.
1.  Canniversal CBD & THC
Widely regarded as the #1 dispensary in San Antonio for THCA flower, live rosin, hash rosin, vapes, concentrates, and edibles. Customers rave about premium quality and variety.
Location: Multiple spots; main at 1234 Example St (check site for nearest).
Highlights: In-store and delivery; strong emphasis on lab-tested products.
Website: canniversal.com (https://www.canniversal.com/)
2.  The Farmacy Botanical Shoppe
Top pick for THCA hemp flower delivery, with strains like Biohazard and Purple Ice earning consistent 5-star reviews for potency and freshness. Affordable at ~$10/g.
Location: Delivery-only in San Antonio (no physical storefront listed).
Highlights: Same-day delivery, USA-grown buds; “best quality in SA” per users.
Website: farmacybotanical.com (https://www.farmacybotanical.com/)
3.  Kiefs Dispensary
A welcoming head shop specializing in premium THCA, CBD, and Delta-9 products. Praised for amazing vibes, flower, and edibles.
Location: 442 Bandera Rd, San Antonio, TX 78228.
Highlights: Local pickup/delivery; great for beginners with curated wellness selection.
Website: kiefsdispensary.com (https://kiefsdispensary.com/)
4.  Reggie & Dro Cannabis Store & Social Club
Members-only (21+) dispensary with onsite consumption lounge—unique for SA. Focuses on legal THCA flower and accessories.
Location: Central San Antonio (exact address on site; social club vibe).
Highlights: Community-focused; free legal weed pioneer in Texas.
Website: reggieanddro.com (https://www.reggieanddro.com/)
5.  HighWay San Antonio Cannabis Delivery
Stands out for same-day delivery of high-quality THCA flower and compliant hemp products. Not your average smoke shop.
Location: Delivery-focused; ships to approved states too.
Highlights: Farm Bill-compliant; converts to THC when heated for effects.
Website: gethwy.com (https://gethwy.com/)
6.  Green Haven Cannabis Co.
Premium hemp shop with handpicked THCA products, tested for purity. Emphasizes wellness and natural benefits.
Location: San Antonio (check site for address).
Highlights: Certified labs; great for edibles and flower.
Website: havenforgreen.com (https://www.havenforgreen.com/)
7.  San Antonio Cannabis Club (SACC)
Local favorite for dispensary-grade THCA flower delivery. Selects top brands for high-THCA buds.
Location: Heart of San Antonio; same-day front-door delivery.
Highlights: Easy online shopping; similar to traditional dispensaries but hemp-legal.
Website: sanantoniocannaclub.com (https://sanantoniocannaclub.com/)
8.  The Plug Dispensary
Reddit-recommended for classic strains like ATF, Sour Diesel, and Gary Payton. Good rosin disposables too.
Location: Universal City (just outside SA, ~15-min drive).
Highlights: Affordable quads; reliable flower quality.
Website: Search locally (no main site in results).
Tips: For authenticity, stick to places with third-party lab results (avoid “in-house” tests per Reddit users). Online options like MARYJAE or Simple Garden offer shipping if local stock is low. Check Yelp or Google for latest reviews, as the scene evolves quickly. If you’re new, start with flower over synthetics like Delta-8. Safe shopping!

AI my ass, thes dumb MF must be shown "The Way" lol and this it it:
The "OG quote," or original source, for the phrase "The Way, the Truth, and the Life" is the Bible. The words were spoken by Jesus Christ in the New Testament Gospel of John.
Original context:
The phrase is found in John 14:6, during a conversation between Jesus and his disciples at the Last Supper.
The disciple Thomas asks Jesus, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, and how can we know the way?".
Jesus replies directly to Thomas: "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me".
Who's Yo Daddy, MF!?!?
REMEMBER: The War Is WON!  We have Victory in TRUTH.  Remind these MF's at every step whenever needed... as little as possible and just as much as necessary, always.  Semper Fi, Gents :slightly_smiling_face:
