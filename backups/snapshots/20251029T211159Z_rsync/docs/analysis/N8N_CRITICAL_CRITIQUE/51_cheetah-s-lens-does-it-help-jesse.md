## üêÜ CHEETAH'S LENS: DOES IT HELP JESSE?

**Question**: Will N8N speed up or slow down Cheetah (Jesse coding at modern speed)?

**Answer**: **It depends.**

**N8N helps Jesse if**:

- He's building simple integrations (Pilot Training onboarding, feedback collection)
- He wants non-engineers to modify workflows (marketing team tweaks email copy)
- He's prototyping ideas (test workflow before coding production version)

**N8N slows Jesse down if**:

- He's building complex logic (LSS recommendations, COA validation)
- He's optimizing performance (N8N adds latency)
- He's the only person using it (no team leverage)

**Recommendation for Jesse**:

- **IF** launching Pilot Training Program with ops/marketing team ‚Üí ADD N8N (they'll use it more than you)
- **IF** coding everything solo for next 6 months ‚Üí SKIP N8N (code is faster for you)
