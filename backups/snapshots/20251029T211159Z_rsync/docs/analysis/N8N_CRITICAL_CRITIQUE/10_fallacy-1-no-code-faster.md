### **Fallacy 1: "No-Code = Faster"** ❌

**Claim**: "N8N is no-code, so we'll build workflows faster than coding them."

**Reality Check**:

- **True for non-engineers** (marketing, ops team building simple workflows)
- **False for engineers** (Jesse can code a workflow in 20 minutes vs. 40 minutes drag-dropping nodes)
- **True for prototyping** (test idea quickly before building production version)
- **False for complex logic** (N8N gets messy; code is cleaner)

**Example**:

- **Simple workflow** (new member → send email → add to CRM): N8N wins (10 min vs. 30 min code)
- **Complex workflow** (COA validation with NIST standards + state regulations): Code wins (60 min vs. 120 min N8N + debugging)

**Fix**: Use N8N for **simple integrations**, code for **complex logic**.
