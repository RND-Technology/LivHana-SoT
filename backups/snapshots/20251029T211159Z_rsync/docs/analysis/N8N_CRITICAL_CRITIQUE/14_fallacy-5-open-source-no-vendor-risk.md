### **Fallacy 5: "Open Source = No Vendor Risk"** ‚ùå

**Claim**: "N8N is open source, so we're not locked in to a vendor."

**Reality Check**:

- **True**: We can self-host and modify code
- **Also True**: We're locked into N8N's workflow paradigm (migrating to another tool = rewriting all workflows)
- **Also True**: If N8N project dies (unlikely but possible), we maintain the code ourselves or migrate

**Vendor Lock-In Score**:

- Zapier/Make (SaaS): 9/10 (fully locked in)
- N8N (self-hosted): 5/10 (locked into tool paradigm, but code is ours)
- Custom code: 1/10 (full control)

**Fix**: Self-hosted N8N reduces vendor risk but doesn't eliminate it. Still need exit strategy.
