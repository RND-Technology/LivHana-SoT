## üìã DECISION FRAMEWORK

**Option A: ADD N8N NOW** ‚ö°

- Deploy self-hosted N8N this week
- Build 5 workflows (Pilot Training, feedback, HNC, merchant onboarding, analytics)
- Team commits to learning + maintaining
- Review ROI in 3 months

**Pros**: Enables non-engineers, rapid prototyping, separates ops from core product
**Cons**: $25K Year 1 cost, maintenance burden, potential workflow spaghetti

---

**Option B: PILOT WITH ZAPIER** üõ°Ô∏è

- Use Zapier (SaaS) for 3 months to validate workflows
- If valuable, migrate to self-hosted N8N
- If not valuable, cancel Zapier (no sunk cost)

**Pros**: No maintenance, faster setup, lower commitment
**Cons**: $100-300/month cost, vendor lock-in, can't self-host

---

**Option C: CODE EVERYTHING** üêå

- Skip N8N entirely
- Code workflows as Node.js scripts
- Use GCP Cloud Functions for scheduling

**Pros**: Full control, no vendor risk, team already knows code
**Cons**: Slower for non-engineers, less flexible for rapid iteration
