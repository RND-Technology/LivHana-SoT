### **Anti-Use Case 2: COA Validation with NIST Standards** ‚ùå

**Why NOT N8N**:

- Complex business logic (NIST validation rules, state regulations)
- High stakes (compliance violations = legal risk)
- Needs version control (audit trail for compliance)
- N8N workflows are harder to version control than code

**Verdict**: Compliance-critical systems = CODE ONLY. N8N too risky.
