- **Mitigation**: Monitor GPT-5 release, negotiate enterprise pricing
- **Fiduciary Impact**: **Cannot make informed decision without pricing clarity**

**Risk 3.3: Agent Error Recovery Dependency (Severity: MEDIUM)**

- **Reality**: If Claude Code fails (10% rate), Codex must coordinate recovery
- **Cost**: $60,000/year in Jesse time
- **Implication**: Codex ROI is COUPLED to other agents' performance
- **Mitigation**: Eliminate Claude Code (replace with Cheetah 100% delivery)
- **Fiduciary Impact**: **Codex cost optimization depends on team optimization**

**Risk 3.4: Single Point of Failure (Severity: HIGH)**

- **Reality**: If Codex goes down, entire Trinity pipeline stops
- **Impact**: No quality gates, no coordination, chaos
- **Probability**: LOW (OpenAI platform is reliable)
- **Mitigation**: Backup coordination protocol (Jesse manual override)
- **Fiduciary Impact**: **Systemic risk to entire team coordination**

**Risk 3.5: No Direct Revenue Impact (Severity: MEDIUM)**

- **Reality**: No documented revenue increases from Codex orchestration
- **Implication**: Benefit calculation relies on cost avoidance, not revenue generation
- **Impact**: Theoretical value, not actual $$ in bank (overhead role)
- **Mitigation**: Focus on measurable revenue outcomes
- **Fiduciary Impact**: **Expensive overhead role ($105K) with no direct revenue**

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Renegotiate Contract IMMEDIATELY** → Revise cost guarantee to $9K/month (realistic)

3. **Optimize API Usage** → Cut costs by 50% (caching, webhooks, reduced polling)
4. **Eliminate Claude Code** → Save $60K/year error recovery cost
5. **Negotiate Enterprise Pricing** → 30-50% discount from OpenAI

#### Fiduciary Verdict: HIGH RISK

- **Acceptable IF**: GPT-5 pricing ≤ $20K/year, contract renegotiated, Claude Code eliminated (saves $60K)
- **Unacceptable IF**: GPT-5 pricing > $50K/year, contract violation persists, single point of failure realized

---

### 4. REPLIT (SONNET 4.5) - SEVERE RISK

#### Critical Risks

**Risk 4.1: SEVERE Overconfidence (Severity: CRITICAL)**

- **Audit Findings**: 7 major fallacies identified in REPLIT_CONTRACT_AUDIT.md
  1. False uniqueness claim (exclusive capabilities that others also have)
  2. Overconfidence bias (99.9% uptime when Replit delivers 99.5%)
  3. Metric gaming ($100K+ revenue dashboard that doesn't create revenue)
  4. Vague success criteria (no measurement methodology)
  5. Unrealistic technical promises (200ms for 10-30 second workloads)
  6. Security theater (unverified encryption claims)
  7. Sunk cost fallacy (implicit "keep me because deployed")
- **Impact**: Trust violation, fiduciary breach, credibility loss
- **Probability**: CONFIRMED (audit documented fallacies)
- **Mitigation**: Contract renegotiation with realistic terms (TIER 0-3 from audit)
- **Fiduciary Impact**: **CANNOT TRUST FUTURE CLAIMS WITHOUT VERIFICATION**

**Risk 4.2: Compliance Risk (Severity: CRITICAL)**

- **Reality**: "DSHS License #690 requires uptime guarantees, cannabis regulations = zero tolerance for outages"
- **Replit SLA**: 99.5% (NOT 99.9% required)
- **Risk**: $50K-100K regulatory fines, license revocation
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (depends on DSHS audit frequency)
- **Mitigation**: "Cloud Run backup deployment, database replication to GCP"
- **Fiduciary Impact**: **CANNOT USE REPLIT FOR PRIMARY PRODUCTION (regulatory risk)**

**Risk 4.3: Single Point of Failure (Severity: HIGH)**

- **Reality**: "No failover plan, no multi-cloud backup, customer orders lost during outage"
- **Impact**: Revenue loss during outage, customer trust erosion
- **Replit Downtime**: ~0.5% historically (3.6 hours/month)
- **Revenue Loss**: Assume $10K/hour sales = $36K/month lost during outages
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (Replit has documented outages)
- **Mitigation**: Cloud Run as primary, Replit as dev/staging only
- **Fiduciary Impact**: **CANNOT ACCEPT PRIMARY PRODUCTION ON SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE**

**Risk 4.4: Vendor Lock-In (Severity: MEDIUM)**

- **Reality**: "Replit-specific workflows hard to migrate, PostgreSQL data export requires manual process"
- **Risk**: If Replit pricing increases or service degrades, expensive migration required
- **Estimated Migration Cost**: $50,000 (re-architect for Cloud Run)
- **Probability**: LOW (Replit is stable, but not impossible)
- **Mitigation**: "Portable architecture (Docker, standard PostgreSQL, 1Password)"
- **Fiduciary Impact**: **$50K exit cost creates strategic inflexibility**

**Risk 4.5: Cost at Scale (Severity: MEDIUM)**

- **Reality**: "Replit pricing increases with usage, Cloud Run more cost-effective at scale"
- **Impact**: Performance degradation or forced migration at 100+ concurrent users
- **Probability**: MEDIUM (depends on business growth)
- **Mitigation**: "Cloud Run as primary, Replit as dev/staging only"
- **Fiduciary Impact**: **CANNOT SCALE BEYOND 100+ USERS ON REPLIT**

**Risk 4.6: Zero Proven Revenue Impact (Severity: MEDIUM)**

- **Audit Finding**: "Dashboard DISPLAYS revenue, doesn't CREATE revenue"
- **Reality**: $0 proven revenue increase from Replit deliverables
- **Implication**: All claimed revenue benefits ($100K+) are FALSE
- **Impact**: Replit delivers staging value ONLY, not revenue generation
- **Mitigation**: Focus on measurable revenue outcomes in new contracts
- **Fiduciary Impact**: **CANNOT JUSTIFY INVESTMENT BASED ON REVENUE GROWTH**

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Reduce to Prototyping Only** → Save $97K/year, improve ROI to 388%
2. **Add Cloud Run Backup** → Meet cannabis compliance (99.9% uptime)
3. **Renegotiate Contract** → Replace TIER 0-3 with realistic terms (from audit)
4. **Portable Architecture** → Use Docker, standard PostgreSQL (reduce vendor lock-in)
5. **30-Day Migration Plan** → Migrate 4 services + PostgreSQL to Cloud Run

#### Fiduciary Verdict: SEVERE RISK

- **Unacceptable**: For primary production (compliance violations, single point of failure)
- **Acceptable ONLY IF**: Prototyping only (1-4 hours), production migrated to Cloud Run
