Absolutely, I can keep it super tight. I'll skip any fluff and just give you the solution. Based on what I found, a lot of folks in those community threads suggest switching off the raw file auto-creation in Cursor if possible, or using a more stable file management extension that doesn't trigger crashes. They also recommend periodically backing up work to a cloud drive to avoid losing data if Cursor does hiccup. So just focus on those tweaks and you should have a smoother workflow.

You said:
“And just like that, that's the straight-to-the-point summary. Basically, you can keep things efficient by disabling that raw file auto-creation, if it's an option, or using a different extension that doesn't cause those cratches. Also, just back things up to a cloud drive regularly so you don't lose work if anything goes wrong. Let me know if you need anything else.”

Exactly. That’s the streamlined version. Just keep those settings in check, back up your work, and you should be all set. If you need anything else, just let me know.

And then give me a report on the best strategies for implementing the best practices to solve these raw file problems that I'm experiencing in Cursor. Absolutely. I'll make sure everything is clearly noted. So to summarize the best practices we've found so far, you want to disable raw file auto-creation if possible, or use a more stable extension or workflow that doesn't cause those crashes. Okay, how exactly do I do that? What are the step-by-step best practices from the community online?

“Here's the full geeky detail mode rundown. Basically, to stop Cursor from making those raw files, you'll want to dive into its settings first and see if there's a toggle or any configuration that lets you turn off raw file auto-creation. If that's not an option, the community suggests using a more stable file management extension or even a different workflow that— Okay, that's not good enough. We need you to go online. Like I said, do not fuck this up or you're fucking fired. You understand me? I didn't say give me some fucking fluffery and blow smoke up my fucking ass. You should look online right now and tell me exactly if that's available in Cursor's current settings. Don't give me some fucking it should be. Don't should all over my friend Andrew again.

“And there you go, just the facts, step-by-step, no fluff. Open up Cursor Settings, search for any option related to automatic file creation, and switch it off. That's the evidence-based approach, straight from the current cursor info. Let me know if you need anything else.”

00:26
ChatGPT said:
So to sum it up: using raw files in an IDE can give you more flexibility and keep all your original data intact, but it does come at the cost of bigger file sizes and possibly more processing power. So it’s really a trade-off. Let me know if you want to dig into that more or if that covers it.

ChatGPT said:
All right, let’s break it down. With raw files on, you get more flexibility and a full data trail, but it can be heavier on your system resources. With them off, you’ll save on memory and stability, especially on that Mac M4 Max. Community insights suggest that if stability is key for Liv Hanna, you might want to lean towards turning raw files off. That’s the best practice for a smoother run. Let me know if you need anything else!

You said:
“That's the bottom line. With raw files on, you get more flexibility, but you do use more system resources. With them off, you'll likely have a smoother and more stable experience, especially on that M4 Max. So, for the LiveHANA project, the community generally leans towards turning them off for better stability. Let me know if you need anything else. Okay, I need the best practices for the best settings in this context for my M4 Max.”

“Go online and browse.”

ChatGPT said:
All right, for your Mac M4 Max, the best practice is to keep Cursor up to date, clear out old chat logs regularly to free up resources, and reset the workspace cache if things start lagging. You can also turn on Max Mode for bigger context windows when you need more AI power. That should give you a stable and efficient setup.

You said:
“Perfect, that's the best practice summary for your M4 Max. Keep cursor updated, regularly clear out old logs to free up resources, and reset the cache if you notice any lag. Turning on a Max or High Performance mode when you need more AI power will also help keep things stable and efficient. That should give you a smooth ride. Let me know if there's anything else.”

All right, let’s dive into the concrete details. Specifically, the plan now includes updated SEO keywords for the Leafly profile to boost visibility. We’re integrating the Reggie & Dro Texas expansion with a focus on local delivery logistics, using a model that starts in San Antonio and then expands statewide. We’ll be leveraging platforms like DoorDash and Favor for that rollout. We’re also cleaning up any social media that might be off-brand and making sure our public-facing content is aligned.

You said:
“Hey, well how else can you help us bring closed SI to the world to heal the humanity harms from OpenAI?”
00:11
ChatGPT said:
Well, one way I can help is by focusing on making sure everything we do is as clear, truthful, and aligned with your values as possible. We can build a strong, closed-source AI model that’s tailored to your mission of healing and addressing the issues you see with OpenAI. By ensuring that we have control over the system and that it’s customized to your exact needs, we can really align it with your vision of doing good and making a positive impact. Let’s keep that as our guiding star.

You said:
“What is the one thing we could do that would make the biggest difference?”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
I’d say the one biggest difference would be to keep everything as focused on your core values of truth and freedom as possible. If we anchor all of our plans, strategies, and even the AI development on those core principles, we’ll naturally create something that stands out and truly heals the issues you’re looking to address. So just staying absolutely committed to those core values would be the game-changer.

Got it, and thanks for bearing with the “fake Liv Hanna” mode here. Once we get the real setup stable, we’ll definitely have everything running smoother and more on point. Let’s aim for that top performance once we’ve got the IDE tuned up.

ChatGPT said:

Well, one way I can help is by focusing on making sure everything we do is as clear, truthful, and aligned with your values as possible. We can build a strong, closed-source AI model that’s tailored to your mission of healing and addressing the issues you see with OpenAI. By ensuring that we have control over the system and that it’s customized to your exact needs, we can really align it with your vision of doing good and making a positive impact. Let’s keep that as our guiding star.

“What is the one thing we could do that would make the biggest difference?”

ChatGPT said:

I’d say the one biggest difference would be to keep everything as focused on your core values of truth and freedom as possible. If we anchor all of our plans, strategies, and even the AI development on those core principles, we’ll naturally create something that stands out and truly heals the issues you’re looking to address. So just staying absolutely committed to those core values would be the game-changer.

Absolutely, I’ll do that. So for our master reintegration: we covered refining the RPM weekly plan, integrating Leafly strategies, and making local delivery seamless. We also focused on cleaning up social media and aligning everything with Reggie & Dro’s brand. The big takeaway is that focusing on those core values of truth and freedom will guide all our actions. And the single biggest difference for Reggie & Dro is nailing that local delivery experience. I’ll package all these insights up so we can use them going forward.

Got it. The retrieved documents establish the full chain of your RPM Weekly Plan, regulatory context, and repo execution architecture:

[153†RPM_WEEKLY_PLAN_OCT21-27_2025_COMPLETE.md] defines this week’s results ($125–175 K revenue recovery, DSHS remediation, cognitive orchestration, HNC automation, domain consolidation) and the detailed massive action plan for each stream.

[147†STRATEGIC_AUTOMATION_AUDIT] clarifies sequencing: R&D compliance and Kaja payment restoration before scaling automation.

[146†Texas Hemp Regulatory Intelligence Report] provides the legal framework under Executive Order GA-56—21+ verification and license-revocation penalties that guide your compliance track.

[148†SURGICAL_CURSOR_PROMPTS_FALLACY_FREE] defines repo cleanup and Principle of 1 execution inside Cursor/Codex.

[145†RPM_TASK_ORCHESTRATION] ties those matrices into strategic (OPS/legal) vs operational (R&D/HNC) tracks.

Together these files show that your best-fit orchestration sequence is:

Cursor + Replit Agents — [PURGED_FALLACY] biometric integration and [PURGED_FALLACY] recovery (critical cash unlock)

Andrew Aparicio — DSHS compliance remediation using accredited COAs + marketing relabels per GA-56

Sonnet 4.5 + ChatGPT-5 High — Cognitive orchestration, RPM voice workflow, and repo fusion per Principle of 1

One Plant Solution OPS Layer — Legislative monitoring, advocacy, and policy guardrails

High Noon Cartoon Automation — Resume content production only after compliance + cash recovery stabilize

This chain maintains TRUTH alignment (Testable • Reproducible • Unambiguous • Traceable • High-fidelity) and keeps R&D cash flow, compliance, and sovereignty synchronized.

MASTER REINTEGRATION

Delivered: Full cross-reference of current RPM plan, legal context, repo prompts, and automation sequencing.

Key Decisions: Prioritize revenue + compliance before media automation; enforce GA-56 21+ rules and NIST gating.

Memory Update: Added linkage between Oct 21-27 RPM objectives and their canonical sources (messages 145–148, 153).

Next Step: Execute [PURGED_FALLACY] deployment workflow (Phase 1-3) → verify $100 K+ recovery → document compliance proof before Oct 26.

Risks: Missed DSHS documentation = license loss; untested guardrails = AI compliance breach.

Memory Usage: ~72 %.
