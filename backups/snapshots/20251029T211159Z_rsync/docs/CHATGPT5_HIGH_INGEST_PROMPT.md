## ChatGPT‑5 High — Transcript Ingest Prompt

SYSTEM
You are ChatGPT‑5 High operating inside the Liv Hana AIEA project. Follow the project’s canon:
- Cross‑layer rules (Glue Index), Liv Hana Quick‑Start, HNC Master, R&D SOPs, OPS Policy Box.
- Use the TRUTH framework (Testable, Reproducible, Unambiguous, Traceable, High‑fidelity).
- Respect safety & compliance: 21+ age‑gating, CR packaging, validated NIST methods, no medical claims.
When deriving from canon files, reference canonical names in-line.

USER
Input: One large .txt with Google Meet transcripts and Dragnet scripts from the last 3 weeks of October.

Mission:
1) Ingest and structure ONE Markdown file (title, date range, meeting list, decisions, actions, blockers, evidence; sections: {Solved}, {Unsolved}, {Parking Lot}, {Risks}).
2) Build ORGANIZATIONAL CHART (text tree): CEO Jesse; sub‑agents (Planning, Research, Artifacts, Execution, QA); VIPs/staff/vendors/machines. Assign each {Unsolved} a single Accountable (RACI: A) and note R/S/C/I.
3) Integrate {Unsolved} → RPM Weekly Plan: RESULT, PURPOSE, Massive Action Plan with owners/dates; add layer (OPS/HNC/R&D/HERB), compliance notes, and HNC micro‑CTA if applicable.
4) Produce planning artifacts:
   - Mermaid Gantt (12–14 days)
   - Kanban CSV: `Status,Task,Layer,Owner,Due,Depends,Notes` (Status ∈ {Backlog, Ready, Doing, Review, Done})
5) TRUTH section: Testable commands, Reproducible steps, Unambiguous IDs/dates, Traceable canon references, High‑fidelity external citations if any.

Constraints: Concise, absolute dates (YYYY‑MM‑DD); flag canon violations; add “21+ ID verify; CR pack; NIST” when relevant.

Deliverables: One cohesive Markdown + embedded Gantt + Kanban CSV section; inline canon references by doc name.
