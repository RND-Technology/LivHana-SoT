## Five-Agent Daily Loop (30–45 min)

- L1.1 Planning: Pull yesterday’s diffs. Choose 1–2 self-upgrade targets. Sources: Glue Index, Quick-Start.
- L1.2 Research: Scan canon/ops notes for friction. Map to constraints (HNC CTA-only, compliance SOPs).
- L1.3 Artifacts: Create one minimal artifact: rubric, checklist, or micro-SOP (TRUTH format). Principle of One.
- L1.4 Execution: Test with a 5‑minute voice pass. Record outcomes.
- L1.5 QA: Validate via TRUTH (Testable, Reproducible, Unambiguous, Traceable, High‑fidelity). Promote or refine.

Guardrails: 21+ age gating, no medical claims, NIST/ISO‑validated methods, brands-not-characters.
