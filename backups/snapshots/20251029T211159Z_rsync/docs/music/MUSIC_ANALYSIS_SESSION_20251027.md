# MUSIC ANALYSIS SESSION - TEXAS MADE TRACKS

## Session Overview

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Time:** Morning session (06:00 - 08:00 CT)
**Format:** Voice mode real-time listening and analysis
**Goal:** Extract audio patterns from existing Texas Made catalog to inform Suno automation system

## Tracks Analyzed

### Queue
- Texas Made - Full catalog review
- Focus areas: Lyrics, beat intensity, auto-tune level, vocal-to-beat balance

### Analysis Framework

For each track, capturing:

1. **Vocal Analysis**
   - Presence and clarity (is vocal intelligible and front-of-mix?)
   - Timbre and tone (warm, raspy, bright, etc.)
   - Auto-tune level (0% = natural, 100% = T-Pain effect)
   - Delivery style (conversational, aggressive, melodic, etc.)

2. **Beat Analysis**
   - BPM and rhythm feel (laid back vs energetic)
   - 808 bass level (subtle, balanced, heavy)
   - Hi-hat pattern (simple, rolling, complex)
   - Overall energy (0-10 scale)

3. **Mix Balance**
   - Vocal-to-beat ratio (vocals louder, balanced, beat louder)
   - Frequency distribution (bass-heavy, mid-focused, bright)
   - Stereo width (narrow/mono, moderate, wide/spacious)
   - Dynamic range (compressed, moderate, dynamic)

4. **Hook Effectiveness**
   - Memorability (can you sing along after one listen?)
   - Placement timing (when does hook first appear?)
   - Repetition strategy (how often does hook repeat?)
   - Sing-along factor (0-10 scale)

5. **Overall Vibe**
   - Genre/style classification
   - Emotional tone (confident, melancholy, aggressive, celebratory)
   - Viral potential (TikTok-ready? Radio-ready? Club-ready?)
   - Target audience
