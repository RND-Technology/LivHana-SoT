## 10X JARVIS ANALYSIS STRATEGY

**Philosophy:** Deep, iterative refinement - 2-3 songs at a time, 3X iteration cycles per song

### Analysis Workflow

#### ROUND 1: Initial Assessment (2-3 songs)
1. **Listen & Document**
   - Full listen, no interruptions
   - Document first impressions
   - Note hook moments, energy shifts
   - Capture emotional response

2. **Technical Analysis**
   - Production quality assessment
   - Genre/style classification
   - Instrumentation breakdown
   - Vocal performance evaluation

3. **Theme Mapping**
   - Identify core themes
   - Map to album concepts
   - Rate theme alignment (1-10)

#### ROUND 2: Comparative Analysis (Same 2-3 songs)
1. **Version Comparison** (if applicable)
   - Side-by-side listening
   - Production differences
   - Hook effectiveness comparison
   - Energy consistency check

2. **Context Within Album**
   - Consider tracklist position
   - Flow with other selected songs
   - Narrative arc contribution
   - Energy pacing impact

3. **Commercial Viability**
   - Single potential
   - Replay value
   - Crossover appeal
   - Marketing angle

#### ROUND 3: Final Refinement (Same 2-3 songs)
1. **Selection Decision**
   - Album assignment (Act as IF / Until YOU Become / Other)
   - Tracklist position recommendation
   - Version selection (if multiple)

2. **Enhancement Notes**
   - Potential remix opportunities
   - Mastering considerations
   - Marketing messaging
   - Visual concept ideas

3. **Documentation**
   - Complete metadata entry
   - Add to album selection doc
   - Update tracking spreadsheet

### Iteration Principles
- **Iteration 1 → 2:** From raw impression to structured analysis
- **Iteration 2 → 3:** From analysis to selection decision
- **2-3 songs at a time:** Manageable depth vs. breadth balance
- **Document everything:** Build knowledge base for remaining 375+ songs

| **Round 3 Complete** | Final decision made | Update selection doc |
| **Selected - Act as IF** | Assigned to first album | Confirm tracklist position |
