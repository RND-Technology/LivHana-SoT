## KEY INSIGHTS

### Jesse's Creative Output
- **386 songs = massive catalog** - Proves sustained creative momentum
- **84 Liked Songs = pre-filtered quality** - Jesse's own curation
- **Willingness to iterate:** Texas Made has 6 versions
- **Clear thematic consistency:** Texas identity throughout
- **Genre experimentation:** Hip-hop, rock, country, trap, reggaeton fusions

### Sonic Identity Emerging
**Two distinct approaches:**
1. High-energy hip-hop/trap with Texas country fusion (modern, urban)
2. Anthemic rock/country-pop with celebration vibes (rooted, traditional)

These align PERFECTLY with Diptych concept:
- "Act as IF" = modern hustle sound
- "Until YOU Become" = rooted arrival sound

### Market Position
- **Texas + hip-hop** = growing market with authenticity
- **Country-rap fusion** = crossover potential
- **Regional pride** = loyal fan base foundation
- **Transformation narrative** = universal appeal

**What Could Go Wrong:**
