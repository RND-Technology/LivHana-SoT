- Vocals and beat balanced on choruses (wall of sound, but vocal clarity maintained)
- **Hook must be IMMEDIATELY clear** (0-3 seconds for reel retention)
- Beat slightly louder on intros/outros (cinematic, but brief)

- Lead vocals: Center (both Jesse and Liv, strong mono compatibility)
- Harmonies: Wide (90-100% stereo spread, but fold to mono well for phone speakers)
- Ad-libs: Wide ping-pong (L/R alternating, viral energy)

- Mid-range: Crystal clear vocals (500Hz-3kHz, where phone speakers live)
- High-end: Crisp but not harsh (5kHz-12kHz, clarity without ear fatigue)
