**Next Best Steps (Execute Immediately):**

1. âœ… Remove "weed" verbiage from reggieanddro.company.site (30 min)
2. âœ… Add product ingredients to all edibles (1 hr)
3. âœ… Upload product photos (3+ per product) (1-2 hrs)
4. âœ… Set up Lightspeed POS shipping payment method (30 min)
5. âœ… Order shipping supplies + circle stickers (30 min)
6. âœ… Email Sam Wahba compliance checklist ETA (5 min)
7. âœ… Contact Leanne Fonte re: DNS/SSL instructions (15 min)
8. âœ… Resolve Leafly phantom billing (30 min)
9. âœ… Draft social media + email announcement (1 hr)
10. âœ… Send Lightspeed billing link to Jesse via Slack (Andrew, 5 min)

**Risks:**

- Bank review delays beyond 48 hours (mitigation: daily Sam Wahba check-ins)
- DNS propagation issues (mitigation: Cloudflare monitoring, rollback plan ready)
- Customer win-back low response rate (mitigation: A/B test offers, segment more granularly)
- Fulfillment bottleneck if >100 orders/day (mitigation: hire temp help, batch processing)
- DSHS permanent rules more restrictive than emergency rules (mitigation: preemptive public comment, TX Truth & Safety Act positioning)
