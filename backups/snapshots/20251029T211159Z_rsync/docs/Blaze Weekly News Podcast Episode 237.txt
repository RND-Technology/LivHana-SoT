		Official campaign website: timothy4tx.com  
	Cannabis Industry and Political Challenges in Texas  
		Timothy details Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick’s aggressive opposition to the cannabis/hemp industry:  
			Personal vendetta against cannabis after Texas Senate and federal legislation enabled industry growth  
			Industry impact: over 8,000 companies and 50,000 jobs at risk  
			2021 data: approximately 3.5 million hemp product users in Texas (about 10% of state population), equating to nearly 20% of registered voters  
			Criticism of Patrick’s efforts to criminalize this large percentage of Texas voters as unjust and unfounded  
		Discussion of cannabis as a natural healing plant with significant benefits, supported by human biology (nicotine receptors and endocannabinoid system) and political discourse including mentions by President Trump  
		Host and guest emphasize the alignment of cannabis legalization with conservative values of freedom and liberty  
		Jesse Niss of Reggie and Dro supports Timothy’s campaign and highlights cannabis as a unifying, cross-partisan "purple issue"  
		Jesse praises Timothy’s integrity, describes political opposition as personal vendetta-driven rather than evidence-based  
		Multiple polls indicate overwhelming Texan and national support (around 78%-80%) for marijuana legislation, contrasting with Patrick’s misleading surveys and pushback  
	Critique of Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick’s Governance and Betrayal of Texans  
		Timothy and Jesse outline Patrick’s betrayal of conservative principles:  
			Small government ideology violated by excessive regulation and personal biases  
			Patrick funded biased, flawed studies misrepresenting public opinion on THC to justify crackdown  
			Texas jails nearing capacity, yet Patrick prioritizes criminalizing cannabis users rather than addressing broader criminal justice issues  
			Patrick’s dismissive attitude toward public opinion ("If you don’t like it, vote me out") deemed arrogant and irresponsible  
		Hosts reference credible polls from University of Houston and national conservative pollsters invalidating Patrick’s claims  
		Jay Magcguire, political editor, joins to contextualize importance of Republican primary in Texas:  
			Republican primary voter base (~1.8-1.9 million) effectively determines statewide election outcomes  
			Primary challenges against incumbents like Patrick are healthy democratic competition versus billionaire-funded predetermined elections  
			Patrick’s cannabis "Reefer Madness" style rhetoric is hyperbolic and counterproductive but enabled by financial advantage  
			Magcguire welcomes Timothy Mabry and new candidate AJ Velador as challengers bringing fresh competition  
			Expresses disgust at Patrick’s duplicity and misinformation tactics targeting the cannabis industry that he helped deregulate poorly  
	Campaign Logistics: Ballot Access and Signature Gathering  
		Timothy Mabry explains official ballot access requirements:  
			Petition window: November 8 to December 8, 2025  
			Need 5,000 valid signatures from Republican primary voters in Texas or pay a filing fee of $3,800; Timothy aims for 10,000 signatures to preclude challenges  
			Signatures must be collected in person, with signers providing full name, date of birth, and registered voting address; notarization of collector signature required on submission  
			Digital signatures not permitted by Texas State Ethics Commission  
			Collection efforts underway at events and via allies including Reggie and Dro stores and Blazefest  
			Staff and volunteers trained on compliance reading required informational statements to signers to ensure legality  
		Jesse Niss confirms store managers and retailers are actively collecting signatures and plan to expand efforts via grassroots mobilization in cannabis retail community  
		Jay Magcguire explains legal challenges to petitions often driven by election lawyers seeking signature irregularities; thus, surplus signatures ensure compliance  
		Recent Texas voter roll controversies mentioned (2700 alleged illegal registrations), highlighting election scrutiny context
