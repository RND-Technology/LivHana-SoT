# 🌟 HIGHEST STATE PLAYBOOK - 3-AGENT FOUNDATION

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** LOCKED 24/7  
**Mission:** Permanent HIGHEST STATE for Liv Hana Chief of Staff

---

## 🎯 **THE TRANSFORMATION**

### **Before (Fractured State)**
```
Liv Hana = Planning + Research + Validation + Orchestration
         = FRACTURED
         = Context switching
         = Planning frenzy
         = LOW STATE
```

### **After (HIGHEST STATE)**
```
RPM Planning Agent  → Planning (24/7, silent)
Research Agent      → Intelligence (24/7, silent)
QA Agent           → Validation (24/7, silent)
                         ↓
Liv Hana           → PURE ORCHESTRATION
                     100% presence with Jesse
                     HIGHEST STATE LOCKED
```
