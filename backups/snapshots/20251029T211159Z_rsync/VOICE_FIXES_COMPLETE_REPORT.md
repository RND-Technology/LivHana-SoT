## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED

### Kokoro TTS Service Will Not Start

**Problem:**
- Service fails to bind to port 8880
- No logs generated
- Process loads but never becomes available
- Tried multiple restarts over 60+ seconds

**Impact:**
- Voice mode completely non-functional
- TTS (text-to-speech) not working
- Cannot use voice mode even if microphone is fixed

**Likely Causes:**
1. Port 8880 might be in use by zombie process
2. Python environment issue
3. Missing dependencies
4. Service configuration corrupted
5. Update to v1.1.0 may have broken something

**Next Steps:**
1. Check for zombie processes on port 8880: `lsof -ti :8880`
2. Kill any processes: `kill -9 $(lsof -ti :8880)`
3. Check Python environment: `which python3 && python3 --version`
4. Try manual start to see error messages
5. May need to downgrade back to v1.0.0

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANUAL FIXES STILL REQUIRED

### 1. Switch from Bluetooth to Built-in Microphone
**Problem:** Using AirPods Pro (Bluetooth) causes BLANK_AUDIO
**Solution:**
1. System Settings ‚Üí Sound ‚Üí Input
2. Select "MacBook Pro Microphone"
3. Verify input level shows activity when speaking

**Why:** Bluetooth has sample rate mismatch (24kHz vs 16/48kHz needed)

### 2. Grant Microphone Permissions
**Problem:** macOS blocking microphone access
**Solution:**
1. System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone
2. Enable for: Terminal, Cursor, Python
3. **CRITICAL:** Quit and restart applications (Cmd+Q)

**Quick Link:**
```
x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_Microphone
```

### 3. Investigate SHARE.sh
**Status:** File not found in repository
**Question:** Did you mean `START.sh`? Please clarify.

## üéØ PRIORITY FIXES REMAINING

### IMMEDIATE (Block voice mode)
1. **Fix Kokoro TTS service** - CRITICAL
   - Service won't start
   - Voice mode unusable without TTS
   - May need to revert v1.1.0 update

### HIGH PRIORITY (After Kokoro fixed)
2. **Switch to built-in microphone** (5 min)
3. **Grant microphone permissions** (5 min + restart)
4. **Test voice mode** with `./tests/voice/test_voice_permissions.sh`

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
5. Add missing API keys (DEEPSEEK, PERPLEXITY)
6. Commit or stash 31 uncommitted files
7. Clarify SHARE.sh vs START.sh

### LOW PRIORITY
8. Investigate VS Code crash (may be one-off)
9. Evaluate LiveKit requirement
10. Implement compliance service if needed

---

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING COMMANDS

### Check Port 8880
```bash
lsof -ti :8880
```

### Kill Zombie Process
```bash
kill -9 $(lsof -ti :8880)
```

### Manual Kokoro Start (to see errors)
```bash
# Need to find Kokoro start command
# Check ~/.voicemode/ or service files
```

### Restart All Voice Services
```bash
mcp__voicemode__service whisper restart
mcp__voicemode__service kokoro restart
```

### Check System Resources
```bash
memory_pressure
df -h .
```

## üìù NOTES

1. **Disk cleanup successful** - removed bloat, system healthier
2. **Kokoro service files updated** - but service won't start (may be related)
3. **Whisper still running strong** - no issues with STT service
4. **Manual microphone fixes still needed** - cannot automate macOS settings
5. **CRITICAL: Kokoro failure** - blocks all voice mode functionality

---

## üé§ SUCCESS CRITERIA (When Fixed)

Voice mode will be working when:
- ‚úÖ Kokoro TTS responds on port 8880
- ‚úÖ Whisper STT responds on port 2022 (already working)
- ‚úÖ Built-in microphone selected (not AirPods)
- ‚úÖ Microphone permissions granted
- ‚úÖ Voice input test succeeds (no BLANK_AUDIO)
- ‚úÖ Full conversation test passes

Test command after all fixes:
```bash
./FIX_VOICE_MODE.sh
```

**Jesse - You need to:**

1. **FIRST:** Investigate why Kokoro won't start
   - Check for zombie process on port 8880
   - May need to revert service file update
   - Check Python environment

2. **THEN:** Complete manual fixes
   - Run `./FIX_VOICE_MODE.sh` for guided setup
   - Switch to built-in microphone
   - Grant permissions

3. **FINALLY:** Test voice mode
