**Product Description:**

**The Cannabis Industry's Dirty Secret:**

Most of what you pay for in "premium" flower is APPEARANCE.

Not potency. Not genetics. Not effect.

Just how it looks.

**Here's What Really Matters:**

1. **Genetics** - What strain is it?
2. **Cannabinoid %** - How strong is it?
3. **Terpene profile** - What's the flavor/effect profile?
4. **Cure time** - How long was it cured?
5. **Testing** - Is it actually lab tested?

**Here's What Doesn't Matter (But You Pay For Anyway):**

6. Bud size (small buds = same genetics)
7. Trim job (hand vs machine doesn't affect potency)
8. Bag appeal (it's going to burn anyway)
9. Instagram-worthiness (nobody cares)

**BRICK vs PREMIUM Comparison:**

| Factor | BRICK | Premium | Does It Matter? |
|--------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **Genetics** | Cheetah Piss | Cheetah Piss | ✅ YES |
| **THCa %** | 22.1% | 28.4% | ✅ YES (but 22% is still strong) |
| **Cure Time** | 30 days | 60 days | ⚠️ SOME (both are good) |
| **Lab Tested** | Yes | Yes | ✅ YES |
| **Bud Size** | Small | Large | ❌ NO |
| **Trim** | Machine | Hand | ❌ NO |
| **Bag Appeal** | Rough | Instagram | ❌ NO |
| **Price/gram** | $5.00 | $15.71 | ✅ YES |

**The Math:**

You're paying $10.71 MORE per gram for:

- 6.3% more THCa (diminishing returns after 20%)
- Prettier buds (burns the same)
- Hand trim (no effect difference)

**Is that worth it?**

For special occasions? Sure.
For daily use? Probably not.

🔬 **The Lab Facts:**

**BRICK:**

- 22.1% Total THCa
- <0.3% Delta-9 THC (legal)
- Same terpene profile as Premium (slightly less pronounced)
- Third-party tested (click to see actual COA)

**Translation:** This will work. Period.

💡 **Who Gets It:**

✅ Daily users (why overpay?)
✅ Edible makers (appearance doesn't matter)
✅ Budget buyers (more flower for your money)
✅ Practical Texans (effect over ego)
✅ Veterans (remember when brick weed was all we had? This is WAY better)

**The History Lesson:**

Old heads remember: Back in the day, "brick weed" was compressed Mexican flower.

This is NOT that.

This is premium genetics, grown in Texas, machine-trimmed for efficiency.

We called it "BRICK" to be honest about the aesthetics.

**The Reviews:** *(social proof dog whistle)*

"22% THCa is plenty for me. Why pay more?" - Anonymous Houston

"I make edibles. This is perfect. Don't waste Premium on butter." - Chef at dispensary (yes really)
