**Tagline:**
> "Not everyone needs top-shelf every time. We get it." 💰

**Product Description:**

**The Honest Truth:**

This is THE SAME Cheetah Piss genetics as our $55 premium.

Same plant. Same grow facility. Same growers.

**So Why $17.50 Instead of $55?**

🌿 **The Difference:**

- **Appearance:** Smaller buds, more shake (but same potency)
- **Trim:** Machine-trimmed vs hand-trimmed
- **Cure time:** 30 days vs 60 days (still way better than most hemp)
- **Bag appeal:** It ain't Instagram-ready, but it WORKS

**Translation:** It looks like $17 weed, but it hits like $50 weed.

🔬 **Lab Facts:**

- 22.1% Total THCa (this batch - still strong AF)
- <0.3% Delta-9 THC (legal in Texas)
- Same genetics as Premium Cheetah Piss
- Third-party tested (view COA)

💡 **Who's This For?**

✅ Daily users who need value (not show-off flower)
✅ People making edibles (why pay for bag appeal?)
✅ Budget-conscious Texans who want quality
✅ Anyone who cares about effect over appearance
✅ Members who buy in bulk (3 BRICKS = price of 1 Premium)

🎯 **The Smart Play:**

Use Premium for special occasions, smoke rooms, impressing friends.
Use BRICK for daily personal use, making butter, pre-rolls.

**Same genetics. Same effect. Less money.**

**The "BRICK" Name Explained:**

We could call it "value" or "budget" but that sounds weak.

"BRICK" is honest. It's compressed flower that looks rough but performs.

Old heads know: Some of the best smoke comes in brick form.

⚡ **Member Pro-Tip:**
Buy 4 BRICKS ($70) instead of 1 Premium ($55). Get 14g instead of 3.5g. Same genetics.

Do the math.

📊 **The Numbers:**

- **Price:** $17.50 / 3.5g (eighth)
- **Per gram:** $5.00 (vs $15.71 for Premium)
- **Potency:** 22.1% THCa (vs 28.4% Premium)
- **Value:** 70% savings for 22% less potency = smart money

🔥 **Stock Status:**
Bricks sell out slower than Premium, but they DO sell out. We have 47 units from this batch.

**Shipping:**
Same-day San Antonio, 2-day Texas-wide. FREE over $75 (buy 5 BRICKS = free shipping).

🐆 **The Insider Secret:**

Most "premium" hemp brands sell machine-trimmed flower at premium prices.

We're upfront: This is machine-trimmed. So we price it accordingly.
