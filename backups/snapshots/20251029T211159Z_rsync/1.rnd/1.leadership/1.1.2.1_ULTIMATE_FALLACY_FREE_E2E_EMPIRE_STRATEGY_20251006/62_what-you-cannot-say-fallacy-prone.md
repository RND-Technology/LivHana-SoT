### What You CANNOT Say (Fallacy-Prone)

- ❌ "Impossible to catch" (it's difficult, not impossible)
- ❌ "60× ahead forever" (requires continuous execution)
- ❌ "Nobody has a better system" (limited competitive data)
- ❌ "$10M valuation guaranteed" (markets decide valuations)
- ❌ "Patent grants by Week 3" (provisionals take months)
- ❌ "200K interactions = 5-year lead" (corrected to 18-month lead)
