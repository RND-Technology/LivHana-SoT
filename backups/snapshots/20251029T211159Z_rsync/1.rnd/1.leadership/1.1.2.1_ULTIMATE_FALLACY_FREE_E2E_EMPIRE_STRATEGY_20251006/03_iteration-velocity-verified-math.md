### ITERATION VELOCITY (VERIFIED MATH)

**Liv Hana Target:**

- **1 improvement/day = 365 improvements/year**
- **Verified daily improvement cycle (automated)**
- **Tracked in BigQuery with timestamps + impact scores**

**Industry Average (Dutchie, Jane, Leafly):**

- **12 improvements/year (quarterly releases)**
- **Manual development cycles**
- **Public release notes as evidence**

**VERIFIED ADVANTAGE: 30.4× faster iteration cycle**

- Year 1: 365 vs 12 = 30.4× faster
- Year 2: 730 vs 24 = 30.4× faster  
- Year 3: 1,095 vs 36 = 30.4× faster

**MEASUREMENT:**

- Daily: Count improvements deployed (automated tracking)
- Weekly: Verify impact (A/B test results)
- Monthly: Competitor release note analysis
