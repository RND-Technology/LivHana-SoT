### Layer 4: **Cannabis Domain Expertise**

**What It Is**: Your AI knows cannabis. Competitors know e-commerce.

**How It Works**:

```
Competitor AI:
"Customer bought product X, recommend product Y" (generic)

Liv Hana AI:
"Customer bought indica-dominant THCa at 28%, previous purchase was
sativa-dominant at 22%, timing suggests evening use preference, COA
shows high myrcene, recommend similar terpene profile but different
strain to avoid tolerance, check DSHS compliance for new batch"

Result: 10x more valuable because domain-aware
```

**Unfuckwithable Because**:

- Cannabis knowledge takes years to build (strain genetics, terpenes, effects, compliance)
- Can't be trained overnight (need real-world data)
- Regulatory expertise (Texas hemp law, DSHS rules, VISA policies)
- Member behavior patterns (Texas-specific preferences)

**Amplification Strategy**:

- Ingest all cannabis research papers (PubMed, scientific journals)
- Train on COA database (10,000+ lab results)
- Build strain effect prediction model (user reports + genetics)
- Add cultivation knowledge (for B2B expansion)

**Time to Replicate**: 18-24 months (domain learning) + data acquisition
