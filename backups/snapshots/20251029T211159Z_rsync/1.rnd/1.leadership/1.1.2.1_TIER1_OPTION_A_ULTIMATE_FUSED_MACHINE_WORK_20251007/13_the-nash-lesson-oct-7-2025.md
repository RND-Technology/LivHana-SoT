### The Nash Lesson (Oct 7, 2025)

**Bad Plan (REJECTED by Jesse):**

- $80K investment
- 12-week timeline
- Complex "white-label setup"
- Made it sound like hiring drivers

**Jesse's Feedback:**
> "1,000X improve this shit plan you proposed: $75K investment and 10-week timeline"

**Good Plan (APPROVED):**

- $0 investment
- 30-minute timeline
- Use Nash's model: Outsource drivers via DoorDash/Uber API
- Just get 2 API keys and launch

**Universal Pattern:**

```
DON'T BUILD:         USE EXISTING:        FILL THE GAP:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Driver fleet    →    DoorDash/Uber    →   Skip Square intermediary
Custom voice    →    ElevenLabs API   →   Add queue management
Custom video    →    D-ID + DALL-E    →   Add production pipeline
Custom analytics →   Google Analytics →   Add TPOP weighting
```

**Applied Across All Projects:**

- ✅ Delivery: Use existing APIs, skip intermediary, save $5-7/order
- ✅ Voice: Use existing APIs, add queue architecture
- ✅ Content: Use existing APIs, add production automation
- ✅ Age verification: Find existing API (don't build custom)
- ✅ Payment: Integrate Stripe/Square (don't build custom)
