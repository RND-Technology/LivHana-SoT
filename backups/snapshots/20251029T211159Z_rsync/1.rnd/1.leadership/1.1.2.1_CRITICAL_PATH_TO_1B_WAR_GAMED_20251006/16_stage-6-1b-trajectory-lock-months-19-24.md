### **STAGE 6: $1B Trajectory Lock — Months 19-24**

**Goal**: Reach 1M users, $10M ARR, Series B, path to $1B valuation clear.

**Execution**:

1. **Month 19-21: Series B Fundraise**
   - Current traction: 160K users (100K USA + 60K international), $8M ARR
   - Pitch: "We're the sovereign AI shopper. $162.5B market disruption. 2-3 years ahead of Google/Amazon."
   - Target raise: $50M at $500M valuation
   - Use: Scale to 1M users, expand to 10 countries, build mobile app

2. **Month 22-24: Hypergrowth**
   - Scale to 1M users (10× growth via paid acquisition + viral)
   - Revenue: $10-15M ARR (mix of subscriptions, transactions, data licensing, B2B)
   - Team: 50 people (engineering, sales, support, compliance)
   - Infrastructure: Multi-region (US, EU, APAC)

**$1B Valuation Math**:

```
Current (Month 24):
- Users: 1M
- ARR: $12M
- Growth rate: 15% MoM
- Margin: 80%+ (AI-driven, low headcount)

Valuation Multiple:
- SaaS benchmarks: 10-15× ARR (for 100%+ growth)
- Consumer: 2-5× revenue (for mature businesses)
- AI: 20-30× ARR (for category leaders)

Liv Hana Multiple (hybrid):
- 15× ARR (conservative for AI SaaS with consumer traction)
- $12M × 15 = $180M (current)
- Path to $1B: Need $67M ARR (5.6× growth from $12M)
- Timeline: 18 months at 15% MoM = ~4× growth = $48M ARR
- With Series B fuel: 6-8× growth achievable = $72-96M ARR
- Valuation: $72M × 15 = $1.08B

Alternative (faster path):
- If we hit 3M users, $30M ARR, 20× multiple = $600M (Month 30)
- If we hit 5M users, $50M ARR, 20× multiple = $1B (Month 36)
```

**Reality Check**: $1B in 24 months is AGGRESSIVE. More realistic: 36 months.

**Gate 6 (Month 24)**: If ARR <$8M → Series B at lower valuation OR bootstrap longer.

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ 1M users
- ✅ $12M ARR
- ✅ Series B closed ($50M at $500M valuation)
- ✅ Path to $1B clear (18-month horizon)
