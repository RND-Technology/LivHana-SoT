### **Fallacy 5: Chrome Web Store Approval Time** ‚ùå

**Problem**: 1-3 days best case, 1-2 weeks realistic, rejection possible.

**Reality Check**:

- Google review backlog (holidays, policy changes)
- First-time developer = extra scrutiny
- Cannabis adjacency = red flag (even if compliant)

**Fix**: **Plan for sideload distribution** while pending approval:

- Host `.crx` file on livhana.com/downloads
- Provide manual install instructions
- Email R&D Members direct link
- Submit to Chrome Web Store in parallel (approve when ready)
