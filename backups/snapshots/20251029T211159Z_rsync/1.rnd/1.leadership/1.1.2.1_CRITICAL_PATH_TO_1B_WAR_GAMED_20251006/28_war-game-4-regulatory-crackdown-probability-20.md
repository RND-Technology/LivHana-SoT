### **War Game 4: Regulatory Crackdown** (Probability: 20%)

**Scenario**:

- Month 8: FTC announces "AI shopping agents must disclose ALL financial relationships"
- Our RVS split (30% to us, 20% to brand) = "kickback" under new rules
- Competitors sue: "Liv Hana is secretly paid by merchants"

**Our Response**:

1. **Transparency First**: Update UI to show RVS split on every recommendation ("We earn $X from this sale")
2. **Fiduciary Defense**: "We're your agent. You approved budget. We negotiate best deal. Here's proof."
3. **Legal Prep**: Andrea Steel (counsel) files brief: "Liv Hana = buyer's agent (legal), not seller's affiliate (regulated)"

**Kill Switch**: If FTC orders cease-and-desist, pivot to subscription-only model (zero transaction fees, pure SaaS).

**Probability We Survive**: 75% (transparency + fiduciary positioning likely holds up legally)
