### **Why This is the Breakthrough:**

**Traditional AI Training**:

- Hire data labelers ($50K-100K/month)
- Synthetic data (AI hallucinates, unreliable)
- Slow (6-12 months to useful dataset)
- No competitive moat (anyone can buy labeled data)

**Liv Hana Pilot Training**:

- Recruit R&D Members ($3K-5K/month incentives)
- Real purchases + verified outcomes (ground truth)
- Fast (800 data points/month from Day 1)
- Unfuckwithable moat (proprietary, impossible to replicate quickly)
