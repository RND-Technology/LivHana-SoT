### **STAGE 3: USA General Model (Non-Cannabis) — Months 4-6**

**Goal**: Prove LSS works for MAINSTREAM Americans (not just cannabis consumers).

**Execution**:

1. **Month 4: Pivot to General E-Commerce**
   - Keep cannabis lane running (175 members, $8K/month)
   - Add general products: Electronics, home goods, apparel (Amazon → D2C alternatives)
   - Recruit 1,000 non-cannabis users (Facebook ads, ProductHunt launch)
   - Offer: "Save 15% on Amazon purchases by buying direct"

2. **Month 5: Scale General Model**
   - Target: 10,000 users (mix of cannabis + general)
   - Partner with 50 Shopify merchants (broader catalog)
   - Revenue mix: 50% cannabis, 50% general
   - Prove: Cannabis data moat (effect outcomes, compliance) gives competitive edge in general shopping (trust, transparency)

3. **Month 6: Subscription Launch**
   - Free tier: Basic recommendations (3 products/search)
   - Plus tier ($9.99/mo): Unlimited recommendations, price alerts
   - Premium tier ($19.99/mo): Concierge service, bulk negotiation
   - Target: 10% conversion (1,000 paid subscribers)
   - Revenue: 1,000 × $12 avg = **$12K/month subscriptions**+ $30K/month transaction fees = **$42K/month total**

**Gate 3 (Month 6)**: If general model conversion <5% → Cannabis-only focus (smaller TAM but defensible).

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ 10,000 users (1,000 cannabis + 9,000 general)
- ✅ 1,000 paid subscribers
- ✅ $42K/month revenue
- ✅ 50 merchant partnerships
