### **War Game 7: Series A Fundraising Fails** (Probability: 40%)

**Scenario**:

- Month 12: Revenue only $300K/month (below $500K target)
- Investors pass: "Market too small" or "Google will crush you"
- Runway: 6 months remaining

**Our Response**:

1. **Extend Runway**: Cut burn rate (reduce paid acquisition, delay hiring)
2. **Revenue Focus**: Prioritize B2B (merchants pay upfront, predictable)
3. **Bridge Round**: Raise $2M from angels/strategic (Andrea Steel's network)
4. **Profitability Push**: Get to breakeven with 50K users (achievable on current trajectory)

**Kill Switch**: If can't raise ANY capital and burn rate too high, sell to competitor (Dutchie, Jane) or shut down gracefully.

**Probability We Survive**: 70% (bridge + profitability push buys 12 more months; time to prove model)
