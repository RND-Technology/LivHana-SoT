### **War Game 2: Pilot Training Program Fails** (Probability: 30%)

**Scenario**:

- Week 4: Only 40 members active (60% dropout)
- Feedback quality poor (members don't complete surveys)
- Data insufficient to train accurate model

**Our Response**:

1. **Increase Incentives**: Raise feedback bonus to $20 (double cost, but better data)
2. **Simplify Surveys**: Reduce from 5 questions to 3 (less friction)
3. **Gamification**: Leaderboard ("Top 10 contributors get free 8th")
4. **Re-recruit**: Replace dropouts with waitlist

**Kill Switch**: If active members <50 by Week 8, pause program, fix incentives, relaunch.

**Probability We Recover**: 80% (program is fixable; core idea sound)
