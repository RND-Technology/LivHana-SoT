### **Conservative Case (Probability: 50%)**

```
Month 6:
- Users: 5,000 (vs. 10K target)
- Revenue: $20K/month (vs. $42K target)
- Burn: $30K/month
- Runway: 12 months remaining

Month 12:
- Users: 50,000
- Revenue: $200K/month
- Burn: $100K/month (profitable on gross margin, but investing in growth)
- Need: Bridge round ($2M) to extend to Month 24

Month 24:
- Users: 200,000
- Revenue: $2M/month ($24M ARR)
- Valuation: $24M × 8 (conservative SaaS multiple) = $192M
- Result: Solid outcome, but NOT unicorn
```

**Path to $1B from here**: Need 5× growth (1M users, $120M ARR) = 36 months total, not 24.
