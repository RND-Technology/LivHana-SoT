### **War Game 1: Google Launches Competing Cannabis AI** (Probability: 40%)

**Scenario**:

- Month 6: Google announces "Google Shopping Agent with Cannabis Support"
- They have 10× our budget, 100× our data (general shopping)
- They offer FREE to consumers (subsidized by ads)

**Our Response**:

1. **Deepen Moat**: Double down on effect outcome data (they can't get this without verified purchases)
2. **Trust Advantage**: Position as "We serve YOU, Google serves advertisers"
3. **Compliance Edge**: Cannabis regulations = our strength, their liability risk
4. **Speed**: We're 12-18 months ahead in cannabis-specific data; maintain velocity

**Kill Switch**: If Google's cannabis AI accuracy >90% (better than ours), pivot to B2B white-label (sell our compliance infrastructure TO Google).

**Probability We Survive**: 70% (moat + trust + compliance advantages hold)
