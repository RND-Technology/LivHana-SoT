## üêÜ RECOMMENDATION

**FULL COMMIT (Option A) ‚Äî First 90 Days:**

**Rationale:**

1. **Window is closing**: Google/Amazon will adapt; 2025-2026 is the first-mover window
2. **Cannabis wedge is perfect**: High complexity, high trust, Google/Amazon can't touch it
3. **Data moat is buildable**: Effect outcomes + COA correlations = 10/10 defensibility
4. **Revenue is real**: $5.4M/year by Month 18 (validated by OpenAI, PayPal, Mastercard launches)
5. **Mission-aligned**: Consumer sovereignty + cannabis freedom = Liv Hana's north star

**Next 3 Actions (This Week):**

1. **Jesse decides**: Option A/B/C? (Recommend A, but Jesse's call)
2. **If Option A**: Build MVA spec (30-question intake, COA parser, recommendation engine v1)
3. **If Option B**: Build MVA, validate with 1,000 users by Month 3, then reassess
4. **If Option C**: Build B2B pitch deck, sell to 5 dispensaries by Month 6
