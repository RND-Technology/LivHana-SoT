#### **Stream 1: Google Ad Revenue ($200B+/year)**

**Traditional Model:**

```
Consumer searches "best THCa flower"
→ Google shows ads
→ Consumer clicks ad ($5-50 CPC)
→ Advertiser pays Google
→ Consumer visits website
→ Maybe converts (2-5% conversion rate)
```

**AI Agent Model:**

```
Consumer asks AI: "What's the best THCa flower for evening relaxation?"
→ AI analyzes preferences, reviews, COAs, prices across ALL sources
→ AI recommends specific product with reasoning
→ Consumer buys directly (80%+ conversion rate)
→ Google gets $0, advertiser saves $5-50 CPC, consumer gets better match
```

**Value Capture Opportunity:** $200B Google ad spend × 70% zero-click rate = **$140B/year** in ad revenue threatened
