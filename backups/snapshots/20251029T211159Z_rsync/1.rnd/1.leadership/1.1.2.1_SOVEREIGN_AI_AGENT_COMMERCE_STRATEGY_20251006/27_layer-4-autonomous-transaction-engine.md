#### **Layer 4: Autonomous Transaction Engine**

**What It Does:**

- Negotiates with merchants on consumer's behalf
- Compares total cost (product + shipping + taxes)
- Applies best available discounts automatically
- Handles checkout (via Mastercard Agent Pay or similar)
- Tracks order status
- Handles customer service (if product doesn't match description)

**Example Flow:**

```
1. Consumer approves AI's recommendation: "Buy Midnight Express from Reggie & Dro"
2. AI checks: Member discount code "STAYTOONED" for 10% off
3. AI calculates: $45 - $4.50 discount + $0 shipping (over $75 order) = $40.50 total
4. AI compares: Still best deal vs. other vendors (Vendor X total cost $55 after shipping)
5. AI executes: Completes purchase via Agent Pay
6. AI monitors: Tracks shipping, alerts consumer when delivered
7. AI follows up: "How was the Midnight Express? Rate the effects for future recommendations."
```

**Consumer Benefit**: Saves 10-30% on average purchase (vs. traditional e-commerce).

**Merchant Benefit**: Higher conversion rate (80% vs. 2-5% traditional), lower customer acquisition cost (no Google ads).
