#### **Advantage 1: High-Trust, High-Complexity Category**

**Cannabis = Perfect Wedge:**

- **High complexity**: COAs, cannabinoid profiles, terpenes, state regulations, effects
- **High trust requirement**: Consumers NEED expert guidance (safety, compliance, efficacy)
- **High Google ad costs**: $20-100 CPC for cannabis keywords (desperate for alternatives)
- **Amazon inaccessible**: Can't sell THCa on Amazon (no marketplace lock-in to compete with)
- **Result**: Consumers NEED an AI agent they trust; traditional models don't work
