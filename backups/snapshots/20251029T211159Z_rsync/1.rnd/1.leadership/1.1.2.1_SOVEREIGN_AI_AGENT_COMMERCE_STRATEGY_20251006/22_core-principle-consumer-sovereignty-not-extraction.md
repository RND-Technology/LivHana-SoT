### **Core Principle: Consumer Sovereignty (Not Extraction)**

**Traditional AI Agents (OpenAI, Google):**

```
Agent serves platform's interests
→ Maximize transaction fees
→ Favor high-margin products
→ Optimize for merchant revenue
→ Consumer is the product
```

**Liv Hana Sovereign Agent:**

```
Agent serves CONSUMER'S interests (fiduciary duty)
→ Find absolute best value (price + quality + compliance)
→ Favor products that match consumer's actual needs
→ Optimize for consumer satisfaction + safety
→ Consumer is the owner (owns their data, owns their agent)
```
