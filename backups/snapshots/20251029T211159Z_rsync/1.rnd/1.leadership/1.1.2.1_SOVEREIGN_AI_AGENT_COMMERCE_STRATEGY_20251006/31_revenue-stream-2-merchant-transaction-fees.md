### **Revenue Stream 2: Merchant Transaction Fees**

**How It Works:**

- Merchants pay 3-8% transaction fee on completed purchases (vs. Amazon's 15-45%)
- Free tier users: Merchant pays higher fee (8%) to get placement
- Plus/Premium users: Merchant pays lower fee (3%) because no ads, pure merit-based ranking

**Fee Structure:**

- **3% fee**: Organic recommendations (AI genuinely thinks it's best product for consumer)
- **5% fee**: Featured placement (merchant pays to be included in "also consider" section)
- **8% fee**: Sponsored recommendations (shown to Free tier users, clearly labeled "sponsored")

**Why Merchants Pay:**

- **80%+ conversion rate** (vs. 2-5% traditional e-commerce)
- **Zero ad spend** (no Google ads needed)
- **Qualified buyers** (AI only recommends to consumers who match product profile)
- **Higher AOV** (AI bundles complementary products)

**Revenue Projection (Month 18):**

- Avg order value: $75
- Avg transaction fee: 5% (blended across tiers)
- Monthly transactions: 50,000 (from 62,000 total users, 80% conversion rate)
- Revenue: 50,000 × $75 × 5% = $187,500/mo = **$2.25M/year**
