#### **Stream 2: Amazon E-commerce Margin ($50B+/year)**

**Traditional Model:**

```
Consumer searches on Amazon
→ Amazon shows algorithmic results (prioritizes high-margin products)
→ Consumer buys (pays Amazon 15-45% referral fee + FBA fees)
→ Amazon keeps $15-45 per $100 order
→ Consumer overpays vs. other channels
```

**AI Agent Model:**

```
Consumer asks AI: "Find me Cheetah Piss THCa, best price, fastest shipping"
→ AI searches Amazon, direct-to-consumer sites, regional dispensaries
→ AI compares total cost (product + shipping + taxes)
→ AI finds direct-to-consumer is 20% cheaper (no Amazon cut)
→ Consumer saves $11, merchant keeps $15 margin, Amazon gets $0
```

**Value Capture Opportunity:** Amazon GMV $600B × 8% take rate (avg) = $48B/year × 30% market shift = **$14B/year** in margin threatened
