### **FINGER 3: COI IMPROVEMENT** âœ‹

**Question**: Do improvement plans directly address weaknesses?

**Validation**:

- [ ] Improvement priorities match Wheel of Life lowest scores
- [ ] Measurable outcomes defined for each category
- [ ] Timeline realistic for legislative deadline (April 7, 2025)
- [ ] Resources allocated to improvement areas

**Example**: If Operations is lowest score, COI should prioritize [PURGED_FALLACY] resolution, not marketing campaigns.
