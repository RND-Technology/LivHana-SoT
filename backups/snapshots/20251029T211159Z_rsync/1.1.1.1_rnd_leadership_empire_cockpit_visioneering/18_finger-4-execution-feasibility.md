### **FINGER 4: EXECUTION FEASIBILITY** âœ‹

**Question**: Can you actually execute with available resources?

**Validation**:

- [ ] Time allocation realistic (hours/week available)
- [ ] Budget sufficient for planned initiatives
- [ ] Team capacity accounts for family/estate obligations
- [ ] Backup plans exist for critical dependencies

**Example**: Planning 70-hour weeks while managing mother's care and estate litigation isn't feasible. Adjust or delegate.
