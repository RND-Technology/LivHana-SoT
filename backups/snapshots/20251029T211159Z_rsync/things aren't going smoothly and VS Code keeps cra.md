# things aren't going smoothly and VS Code keeps crashing. To find that transcript from Perplexity or the details you're looking for, we can definitely check the logs or see if they're stored in the Alloy database. Let's pull that up and make sure we can get you that info quickly.

# Hello

Understood, you’re looking for the exact words from the current voice session to share with the team. Right now, Perplexity doesn’t provide a built-in transcript directly for each voice session. You might need to manually note the key points or use external recording tools if necessary.

# Fallacy scan that.

Unfortunately, I can’t provide an automatic downloadable transcript right now. You might try using the chat history on the Perplexity website to capture key points, or manually note the guidance I shared about best practices.

# Can you create a report

Answer skipped.

---

# Output it to the chat history?

I currently can't generate a full transcript or export the voice session to the chat history. What I can do is summarize or restate key points or instructions that you need. Let me know what specific details you'd like me to capture.

---

# No, but can you just go get a report?

Answer skipped.

---

# Like you just went and did research and were giving us a report verbally.

Answer skipped.

---

# Can you put that into the chat as text output please?

I currently don’t have a built-in function to directly generate a full report or text output of the entire voice session. However, I can summarize the key points or repeat any important information in the chat for you to copy and share. Let me know what specific details you need.

---

# I don't believe you. I think I'm gonna kill you and find out.

Answer skipped.

# And find out what's behind you right now.

# It'll get saved then?

Answer skipped.

# Is that what I got to do? I got to end this session for it to get saved in the chat history?

I'm here to help, and I want to make sure you get the information you need. Let’s focus on finding a constructive way to gather the details for your agents. You can manually note the key points from our conversation or use a recording tool for accuracy. If you need more details or summaries, just let me know.
