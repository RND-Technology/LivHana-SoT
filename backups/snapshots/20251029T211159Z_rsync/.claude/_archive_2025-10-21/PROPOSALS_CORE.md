## ü§ñ PROPOSAL #1: SONNET (Claude Code - Current Session)

### Submitted: 2025-10-06 20:45 PDT

### Status: AWAITING JESSE'S DECISION

### **Focus**: Optimize existing profit engine FIRST, build new SECOND IN PARALLEL

### **Phase 1: Fix Existing Profit Engine (24 hours)**

**Target**: Multiply reggieanddro.com revenue by removing blockers

1. **Fix Ecwid Category Box CSS Bug** (2 hours)
   - Method: Playwright automation or middleware proxy
   - Impact: Customers see categories ‚Üí easier navigation ‚Üí estimated 10% conversion improvement
   - Blocker: Ecwid API permissions (awaiting support ticket)
   - Workaround: Browser automation with admin credentials

2. **Connect Real Lightspeed API** (6 hours)
   - Current: Mock data only (lightspeed-client.js)
   - Target: Real inventory sync
   - Impact: Eliminate manual inventory updates ‚Üí save Jesse's time
   - Technical: Replace mock getProducts() with real API calls

3. **Validate Full Checkout Flow** (2 hours)
   - Test: Product page ‚Üí Cart ‚Üí Checkout ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí Order capture
   - Fix: Any friction points in payment flow
   - Impact: 1% checkout improvement = thousands in recovered revenue

**Success Metric**: reggieanddro.com conversion rate measurably increases

### **Phase 2: Deploy Idle Assets (48 hours)**

4. **Launch AI Crisis Consulting** (8 hours)
   - Deploy: aicrisisconsult.com landing page
   - Outreach: 100 cannabis CEOs via LinkedIn
   - Case study: "Cannabis AI Disaster" report
   - Potential: $5K-$10K first client within 7 days

5. **White-Label Compliance SaaS** (16 hours)
   - Package: Existing R&D compliance system
   - Target: 10 cannabis businesses outreach
   - Potential: $500-$2K/month per client (proven system)

### **Phase 3: Scale What Works (AFTER Phase 1-2 prove ROI)**

6. **Replicate Proven Model** (conditional)
   - Clone reggieanddro.com to 3 domains with propagated DNS
   - Test with minimal traffic
   - Scale ONLY if profitable

### **What Sonnet Will NOT Do:**

- ‚ùå Build 23 unproven stores before fixing working one
- ‚ùå Promise revenue targets beyond control
- ‚ùå Work on infrastructure before profit optimization
- ‚ùå Ignore existing assets to build new ones

### **What Sonnet Guarantees:**

- ‚úÖ Ecwid category fix deployed (customers see products properly)
- ‚úÖ Lightspeed API connected (real inventory, no mock data)
- ‚úÖ Checkout flow validated (no broken payment steps)
- ‚úÖ AI Crisis Consulting launched (landing page + 100 CEO outreach)
- ‚úÖ Zero manual intervention (machines handle technical work)

### **Timeline**: 3 days for Phase 1-2 complete

### **ROI Math (Conservative)**

Current reggieanddro.com (hypothetical):

- 1,000 visitors/month √ó 2% conversion = 20 orders √ó $75 = $1,500/month

After fixes (20% improvement):

- 1,000 visitors/month √ó 2.4% conversion = 24 orders √ó $75 = $1,800/month
- **+$300/month passive increase**
- **+$3,600/year from 3 days work**

VS building 23 new stores:

- Weeks of work, $0 until traffic proven, high risk
