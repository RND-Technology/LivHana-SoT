# 1PASSWORD CLI FIX - EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-23 10:25 AM
**Status:** ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - EXECUTING FIX

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### What We Found:
- ✅ 1Password Desktop app IS running (PID 822)
- ✅ CLI version 2.32.0 installed
- ❌ **CRITICAL: `op whoami` shows "account is not signed in"**
- ❌ CLI session not established despite Desktop integration enabled

### Why This Happens:
When CLI integration is newly enabled in Desktop app, the CLI doesn't automatically inherit the session. The Desktop app needs to:
1. Be fully restarted after enabling CLI integration
2. Establish socket communication with CLI
3. CLI needs to authenticate through the Desktop app

## FIX SEQUENCE

### PRIMARY FIX (Most Likely to Work)

**Step 1: Restart 1Password Desktop App**
```bash
# Close 1Password completely
killall "1Password" "1Password Helper" "1Password Browser Helper"

# Wait 3 seconds
sleep 3

# Reopen 1Password Desktop
open -a "1Password"
```

**Step 2: Wait for Desktop to fully initialize (30 seconds)**

**Step 3: Authenticate CLI through Desktop**
```bash
# This should now trigger biometric prompt in Desktop app
op account list

# Verify authentication
op whoami --format json
```

**Step 4: Test secret read**
```bash
op read "op://LivHana-Ops-Keys/supabase-service-role/credential"
```

### FALLBACK FIX (If Primary Fails)

**Option A: Explicit Account Signin**
```bash
# Sign in using account shorthand
op signin reggiedro

# Or sign in using full domain
op signin high@reggieanddro.com
```

**Option B: Check Desktop Integration Status**
```bash
# Verify CLI integration status
op account list --format json

# If no accounts, re-enable in Desktop:
# 1Password > Settings > Developer > Command Line Interface > Enable
```

### FALLBACK FIX 2 (Service Account Token)

If user authentication continues to fail, use service account token:

```bash
# Set service account token (Jesse needs to create this in 1Password)
export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN="ops_xxxxx"

# Test with service account
op whoami
op read "op://LivHana-Ops-Keys/supabase-service-role/credential"
```

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] `op whoami` returns account info (not "not signed in")
- [ ] `op account list` shows reggiedro account
- [ ] `op vault list` shows LivHana-Ops-Keys vault
- [ ] `op read "op://LivHana-Ops-Keys/supabase-service-role/credential"` returns secret
- [ ] integration-service can start and load secrets

## NEXT STEPS AFTER FIX

1. Update `.env.integration` with working configuration
2. Test integration-service startup
3. Verify all 5 secrets load correctly
4. Document working configuration for future reference
