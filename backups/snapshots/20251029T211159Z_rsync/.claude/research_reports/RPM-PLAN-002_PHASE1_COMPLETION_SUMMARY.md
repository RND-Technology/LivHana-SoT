## KEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### Q1: Which methodology best fits surgical tasks?
**Answer**: Evidence-Based Scheduling (after bootstrap) or PERT (cold start)
- Surgical tasks show consistent velocity patterns ideal for EBS
- PERT provides excellent baseline with low standard deviation
- Expected Value commitments appropriate (with 10-15% aggregation buffer)

### Q2: Which methodology best fits exploratory tasks?
**Answer**: Monte Carlo Simulation with PERT inputs
- Captures "fat tail" distributions of exploratory work
- Confidence intervals (P75/P80) enable appropriate risk communication
- Wide bounds reflect genuine uncertainty without false precision

### Q3: How to combine methodologies for hybrid approach?
**Answer**: 2-Tier Framework with phased rollout
- Classification first (rule-based → ML as data grows)
- Surgical: PERT → PERT+EBS as historical data accumulates
- Exploratory: Wide PERT → Monte Carlo for high-uncertainty tasks
- 3-phase bootstrap strategy documented (0-2mo, 2-4mo, 4+mo)

### Q4: What features predict task type?
**Answer**: 11 features identified, 3 core features sufficient for 75-85% accuracy
- **Tier 1 (Must-Have)**: Requirements Completeness, Specification Clarity, Unknown Unknowns Flag
- **Tier 2 (High-Value)**: Scope Isolation, Precedent Exists, Acceptance Criteria Measurability
- **Tier 3-4**: Technology Familiarity, External Dependencies, Duration, File Count, NLP Keywords
- Decision rule: Surgical if Completeness≥8 AND Clarity≥7 AND No Unknown Unknowns

### Q5: How to bootstrap model with limited data (<50 tasks)?
**Answer**: 3-phase bootstrap strategy developed
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Manual classification, PERT with 20% buffer, immediate tracking
- **Phase 2 (Months 2-3)**: Data accumulation (30-50 tasks), velocity calculation, rule refinement
- **Phase 3 (Month 4+)**: Introduce Monte Carlo and EBS, optional ML classification if 50+ labeled tasks
- Alternative strategies: External benchmarks, aggressive timeboxing, phased estimation, consultant calibration

## TIME TRACKING

### Estimated vs. Actual

| Component | Estimated | Actual | Variance |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Literature Search | 30 min | 35 min | +17% |
| PERT Research | 25 min | 20 min | -20% |
| Monte Carlo Research | 25 min | 20 min | -20% |
| EBS Research | 25 min | 20 min | -20% |
| Classification Research | 20 min | 25 min | +25% |
| Cold-Start Research | 15 min | 15 min | 0% |
| Report Writing | 60 min | 95 min | +58% |
| Review & Editing | 10 min | 15 min | +50% |
| **TOTAL** | **150 min** | **245 min** | **+63%** |

### Variance Analysis

**Root Causes of 63% Overrun**:
1. **Underestimated synthesis complexity**: Research yielded deeper insights than anticipated, requiring more integration work
2. **Scope expansion**: Task classification emerged as richer topic (feature engineering, ML considerations)
3. **Writing quality**: Aimed for actionable, production-ready report rather than academic summary
4. **Iterative refinement**: Multiple passes to ensure practical applicability

**Meta-Learning**:
This task itself was **exploratory** (research with unknown depth), not surgical. The 63% overrun is within expected range for exploratory work. Should have used PERT:
- Optimistic: 120 min
- Most Likely: 180 min
- Pessimistic: 300 min
- **PERT Expected Value**: (120 + 4×180 + 300) / 6 = 190 min

**Actual (245 min) vs PERT (190 min)**: 29% over, much closer than initial 150 min estimate.

**Lesson**: Even this estimation research task validates the framework's core insight - task type classification is critical for accurate estimation.

## KEY INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Critical Insights

1. **Classification is the Linchpin**: Task type misclassification causes more estimation error than methodology choice
   - False positive (exploratory → surgical): Leads to chronic underestimation, erodes trust
   - False negative (surgical → exploratory): Wastes resources, reduces velocity
   - Recommendation: Err toward exploratory for borderline cases

2. **No Silver Bullet**: Each methodology has context-dependent strengths
   - PERT: Simple, requires no historical data, good baseline
   - Monte Carlo: Best for quantifying exploratory uncertainty, requires tooling
   - EBS: Highest long-term accuracy, requires 30-50 tasks per person minimum

3. **Bootstrap is Critical**: Cold-start problem is real but solvable
   - Start simple (PERT + rules), evolve to sophisticated (EBS + Monte Carlo + ML)
   - Resist premature optimization - don't deploy ML classification with <50 labeled examples
   - Track from day 1, even if not yet using data for predictions

4. **Commitment Strategy Matters**: What percentile you commit to defines trust relationship
   - Internal planning: P50 (median) enables aggressive velocity
   - External commitments: P75-P80 (conservative) builds reliability reputation
   - Fixed contracts: P90 (very conservative) protects against penalties

5. **Continuous Calibration Required**: Estimation is a perishable skill
   - Weekly retrospectives on estimate vs. actual
   - Track velocity drift over time (detects process changes, team composition shifts)
   - Update classification rules as team/product matures

### Immediate Next Steps

**Phase 2: Implementation Planning**
1. Design tracking spreadsheet/tool (fields identified in report)
2. Schedule 1-hour team training on PERT and classification
3. Identify 10 pilot tasks for initial estimation practice
4. Set up weekly calibration meeting (15-30 min)

**Phase 3: Pilot Execution**
1. Execute 30-50 tasks with full tracking (Weeks 1-4)
2. Calculate initial velocities and identify biases (Week 5)
3. Refine classification rules based on data (Week 6)
4. Decide on Phase 2 methodology rollout (EBS vs Monte Carlo)

**Phase 4: Scaling & Automation**
1. Train ML classification model if 50+ tasks (Month 3)
2. Integrate with PM tools (Jira, Linear, etc.)
3. Expand to additional teams with cross-calibration
4. Publish internal case study and playbook
