=== EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR JESSE CEO ===
As of: 2025-10-26T20:45:00Z

# TIME ESTIMATION PROTOCOL - STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

**Recent Evidence**: 3 production blockers completed in **5 minutes** vs **95-minute QA estimate** = **19x variance**

**Root Cause**: Surgical tasks (exact specs, isolated scope) execute near-instantly, but traditional estimation treats all work the same.

**Strategic Value**: Build evidence-based time estimation protocol that **learns from every task completion**, progressively improving planning accuracy across the entire ecosystem.

---

## WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

### 5 Core Components

1. **2-Tier Estimation Framework**: Decision tree distinguishing surgical vs exploratory tasks
2. **Variance Tracking System**: JSON database capturing all task metadata + actual time
3. **Regression Model**: Machine learning model predicting actual time from task characteristics
4. **RPM Plan Integration**: Automatic time tracking in all weekly plans (zero overhead)
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Automated retraining as new data arrives (10% accuracy improvement per quarter)

---

## KEY RESULTS COMMITTED

**R1: 2-Tier Framework** (6 actions, Days 1-2)
- Distinguish surgical (exact specs, instant execution) from exploratory (discovery required)
- Classification accuracy: 90%+ on retrospective tasks

**R2: Variance Tracking** (5 actions, Day 3)
- Comprehensive database capturing all task attributes + time actuals
- Target: 50 tasks Month 1, 100 tasks Month 2, 200+ tasks Month 3

**R3: Regression Model** (7 actions, Days 3-5)
- Predict actual time from task metadata with confidence intervals
- Accuracy target: R² ≥ 0.5 (production model), R² ≥ 0.7 (high-accuracy model)
- 80% of predictions within 2x actual time

**R4: RPM Integration** (4 actions, Days 6-7)
- Auto-estimate all actions in RPM plans
- One-command completion tracking (updates plan + database)
- Zero overhead for team adoption

**R5: Continuous Improvement** (3 actions, Day 7)
- Automated retraining every 10 tasks or weekly
- Progressive accuracy gains (compounding over time)
- Adaptive to velocity changes, tool changes, team composition

- **Improve forecast accuracy** for current RPM plans (BOOT, PLAN initiatives)
- **Data-driven planning** replaces guesswork and debate

### Medium-Term Impact (Month 2-3)
- **Stakeholder confidence** via evidence-based estimates with confidence intervals
- **Resource optimization** by identifying which task types take longest
- **Agent performance insights** (which agents fastest for which task types)

### Long-Term Impact (Q1-Q2 2026)
- **Compounding accuracy gains** (10% per quarter, 40%+ annual improvement)
- **Predictive project timelines** (aggregate action estimates → project ETA)
- **Strategic intelligence** (velocity trends, bottleneck identification, capacity planning)

## DECISION POINTS FOR JESSE

### Immediate Decisions (Today)
1. **Approve plan execution?** (Ready to start Phase 1 research today)
2. **Priority level?** (P0 strategic infrastructure vs P1 nice-to-have)
3. **Resource allocation?** (Full-time agents Days 1-7 vs part-time)

### Week 1 Decisions
1. **Model selection?** (Linear regression baseline vs XGBoost/Random Forest production model)
2. **Accuracy threshold?** (Deploy at R² 0.5 vs wait for R² 0.7)
3. **Integration approach?** (Auto-estimate all RPM plans vs opt-in per plan)

### Month 1 Decisions
1. **Retraining frequency?** (Every 10 tasks vs weekly schedule vs performance-driven)
2. **Public visibility?** (Internal tool vs share methodology with industry)
3. **Advanced features?** (Effort estimation, resource allocation, project timelines)

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

**Risk 1: Insufficient Training Data**
- **Impact**: Model unreliable with <50 tasks
- **Mitigation**: Start with baseline model (20 tasks), improve incrementally
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks to reach 100-task dataset

**Risk 2: Feature Drift**
- **Impact**: Model becomes outdated as team/tools change
- **Mitigation**: Continuous retraining protocol adapts automatically
- **Detection**: Monitor MAPE trend, alert if increases >10%

**Risk 3: Overfitting on Surgical Tasks**
- **Impact**: Model biased toward surgical tasks (recent data)
- **Mitigation**: Proactively capture exploratory task data, balance dataset 50/50
- **Action**: RPM Planning Agent tracks task type distribution

**Risk 4: Team Adoption Resistance**
- **Impact**: Scripts unused, no data accumulation
- **Mitigation**: Zero-overhead integration (auto-estimation, one-command completion)
- **Action**: Make estimation seamless part of existing RPM workflow
