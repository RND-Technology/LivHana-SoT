## Push Status: Blocked (But Work is SAFE)

**Issue:** GitHub secret scanning detected old LightSpeed token in commit history

**Affected Commit:** df3a77017 (from earlier session)

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Secret removed from current files
- ✅ All work saved locally (79 commits ahead)
- ⚠️ Cannot push to GitHub until secret resolved

---

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Allow Secret via GitHub (QUICKEST)
Visit this URL and click "Allow secret":
```
https://github.com/RND-Technology/LivHana-SoT/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34juSJjxZoZIy07f0UfjBGhBpWd
```

This tells GitHub the secret is safe to push (since it's already rotated in 1Password).

### Option 2: Create Clean Branch (SAFEST)
Create a new branch without the problematic commit:
```bash
git checkout -b fix/mobile-control-po1-clean
git push -u origin fix/mobile-control-po1-clean
```

Then create PR from the clean branch.

---

## Verification Commands

To verify everything is saved:
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# See last 10 commits
git log --oneline -10

# Verify specific files exist
ls -la .claude/PO1*.md
ls -la .claude/SESSION_COMPLETE*.md
ls -la scripts/ops/weekly_drift_scan.sh
```

---

## Summary

✅ **100% of work is saved locally in git**
✅ **79 commits ahead of remote**
✅ **Working tree is clean (no unsaved changes)**
⚠️ **Push blocked ONLY by historical secret (not current work)**

**YOU HAVE NOT LOST ANY WORK.**

All files from the session (06:44-07:18) are safely committed in the local repository. The push failure does NOT mean the work is lost - it just means we need to resolve the secret scanning issue before GitHub will accept the push.

---

**Next Step:** Choose Option 1 (quick) or Option 2 (safe) above to push to remote.
