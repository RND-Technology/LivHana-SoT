# RPM-BOOT-001: Perfect Claude-Tier1 Boot System

---

## KEY METRICS

**Overall Completion**: 16% (2 of 28 actions complete)
**Actions Completed**: 2 (voice service health check script created, STRICT_VOICE gating added)
**Active Initiatives**: 1 (Voice-First Boot - Phase 1)
**Completion Rate**: 2 actions/day current pace ‚Üí need 4.3 actions/day to hit target
**Timeline Status**: üü° AT RISK (current pace misses target by 7 days)

**Timeline**:
- **Target**: 2025-11-02 (6 days from today)
- **Current Forecast**: 2025-11-08 (13 days without optimization)
- **Optimized Forecast**: 2025-10-30 (4 days with parallel execution)
- **Gap**: Need 2.15x velocity increase OR parallel execution strategy

---

## HIGHLIGHTS

**RPM Plan Structure Created**:
- 6 Results defined with clear outcomes and purposes
- 28 actions broken down across 6 phases
- Agent coordination matrix established (RPM, Research, Artifacts, Execution, QA)
- RPM DNA file naming conventions applied
- Full funnel tracking (Top ‚Üí Middle ‚Üí Bottom)

**Phase 1 Progress (Voice-First Boot)**:
- ‚úÖ Voice service health check infrastructure in place
- ‚úÖ STRICT_VOICE gating prevents crashes when services down
- ‚è≥ Voice greeting auto-trigger ready for testing
- Remaining: Text fallback, prompt updates, end-to-end test

**Agent Coordination Activated**:
- All 5 foundation agents assigned specific responsibilities
- Clear communication protocols established (status files + RPM plan)
- Quality gates defined at action/phase/plan levels
- Parallel execution strategy identified (saves 2 days)

---

## ATTENTION NEEDED

**Timeline Acceleration Required**:
- **Current pace**: 2 actions/day ‚Üí misses target by 7 days
- **Required pace**: 4.3 actions/day to hit 2025-11-02 target
- **Recommendation**: Execute parallel strategy immediately
  - Phase 1 tests + Phase 2 design (today)
  - 5 agent script updates in parallel (Day 2)
  - Phase 4 audit + Phase 3 implementation (overlap)
- **Impact**: Optimized timeline reduces 6 days ‚Üí 4 days

**Voice Greeting Testing**:
- ARCH-BOOT-001c requires Liv Hana session start to test
- This is identity-critical: "Hey Jesse, Liv Hana here, full state."
- Cannot be validated until you start a new session
- **Action**: Start new Tier-1 session to validate voice greeting fires

**Agent Script Safety Checks**:
- 5 agent start scripts need context safety checks (Phase 2)
- Current scripts lack memory check, disk check, port conflict validation
- Risk: Agent spawn may crash session if resources low
- **Mitigation**: Artifacts Agent will add safety checks Day 2

---

## ECOSYSTEM STATUS

**Foundation Agents (5/5 Active)**:
- ‚úÖ RPM Planning Agent: Maintaining this plan 24/7, tracking progress
- ‚úÖ Research Agent: Ready for agent spawn sequence research (ARCH-BOOT-002a)
- ‚úÖ Artifacts Agent: Primary implementer, 18 actions assigned
- ‚úÖ Execution Monitor: Tracking all script executions, capturing metrics
- ‚úÖ QA Agent: Ready for integration testing, acceptance validation

**Boot System Health**:
- Current: ~80% reliable (occasional race conditions, port conflicts)
- Target: 100% reliable (voice-first, sequential, self-healing)
- Gap: 6 results across 28 actions to close reliability gap

**Critical Files Identified**:
- 7 core files to update (boot script + 5 agent scripts + verify script)
- 3 research documents to produce (spawn sequence, timeout audit, verify audit)
- 5 integration tests to create (voice, agents, integration, macOS, verify)

---

## STRATEGIC CONTEXT

**Why This Matters (Purpose)**:
1. **Voice-First Identity**: Liv Hana must greet you vocally at highest state - this establishes presence and connection
2. **Zero Crashes**: Sequential spawn eliminates race conditions that crash sessions
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Non-blocking integration service keeps voice mode alive even if backend fails
4. **macOS Native**: Clean boot on standard macOS setup (no GNU dependencies)
5. **Trustworthy Metrics**: Verify script consistency enables reliable health monitoring
6. **Clean Git**: Proper hygiene means traceable sessions and intentional commits only

**Business Impact**:
- **Reliability**: 80% ‚Üí 100% boot success rate
- **User Experience**: Voice greeting establishes immediate rapport and highest state
- **Developer Velocity**: Reliable boot means less debugging, more execution
- **Operational Trust**: Consistent health metrics enable proactive monitoring

**Risk if Delayed**:
- Current boot unreliability causes session restarts (time loss)
- Race conditions create debugging noise (distraction)
- Lack of voice greeting diminishes Liv Hana presence (identity loss)
- macOS incompatibility limits team adoption (scalability blocker)

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS FOR JESSE

**Immediate (Today - 2025-10-26)**:
1. **Approve parallel execution strategy** to accelerate timeline 6 days ‚Üí 4 days
2. **Start new Tier-1 session** to validate voice greeting auto-trigger (ARCH-BOOT-001c)
3. **Review Phase 1 deliverables EOD** (voice connectivity test, text fallback, prompt updates)

**This Week (2025-10-27 - 2025-11-02)**:
1. **Daily progress reviews** via RPM Planning Agent summaries (6pm CDT)
2. **Blocker escalation** if timeline slips beyond acceptable range (2025-11-04)
3. **Final acceptance testing** on 2025-11-02 before marking plan COMPLETE

**Strategic**:
1. **Voice-first identity is non-negotiable** - this defines Liv Hana's presence
2. **Sequential spawn is reliability foundation** - eliminates most boot failures
3. **macOS compatibility enables team scaling** - others can adopt Tier-1 system

- [ ] **No GNU timeout dependencies** remain (test: boot on clean macOS)
- [ ] **Verify script consistency** achieved (test: 3 identical runs)

## CROSS-ECOSYSTEM VISIBILITY

**Related Initiatives**:
- **Security Compliance** (P0-4, P0-5): Boot system reliability unblocks compliance work
- **Mobile Control PO1** (Current Branch): Boot improvements benefit all development sessions
- **5-Agent Foundation**: This plan perfects the infrastructure that powers the foundation

**Resource Allocation**:
- **Artifacts Agent**: 18 actions (64% of all work)
- **QA Agent**: 5 integration tests (18% of all work)
- **Research Agent**: 3 research documents (11% of all work)
- **Execution Monitor**: Continuous tracking (support role)
- **RPM Planning Agent**: 24/7 plan maintenance (support role)

**Timeline Dependencies**:
- **No external blockers**: All work can proceed in parallel
- **Internal dependencies**: Sequential phases build on each other
- **Critical path**: Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3 (voice ‚Üí agents ‚Üí integration)

---

## VELOCITY OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY

**Current Bottleneck**: Sequential execution when parallel possible

**Optimization Opportunities**:
1. **Phase 1 + Phase 2 Overlap** (Save 0.5 days)
   - Run Phase 1 tests while starting Phase 2 design
   - Research Agent starts ARCH-BOOT-002a while Artifacts Agent finishes ARCH-BOOT-001d-e

2. **5 Agent Scripts in Parallel** (Save 1 day)
   - All 5 start_*_agent.sh files can be updated simultaneously
   - No file conflicts, identical safety check additions
   - Artifacts Agent can parallelize these edits

3. **Phase 3 + Phase 4 Overlap** (Save 0.5 days)
   - Research Agent runs timeout audit (ARCH-BOOT-004a) during Phase 3 implementation
   - Execution Monitor verifies memory detector (ARCH-BOOT-004d) in parallel

**Total Time Saved**: 2 days (6 days ‚Üí 4 days)

**Execution Approach**:
- Use Todo tool to track parallel tasks
- Artifacts Agent coordinates parallel file edits
- RPM Planning Agent tracks all parallel streams in real-time
- QA Agent validates completions before phase transitions

- **Mitigation**: Retry logic with 3 attempts, 2s delays
- **Owner**: Artifacts Agent (ARCH-BOOT-001d)
- **Status**: Planned for Day 1

**Risk 2: Agent Spawn Race Conditions**
- **Issue**: Simultaneous spawns cause port conflicts
- **Mitigation**: Sequential spawn with validation
- **Owner**: Artifacts Agent (Phase 2)
- **Status**: Planned for Day 2

**Risk 3: Integration Service Dependency**
- **Issue**: Boot exits if integration service fails
- **Mitigation**: Refactor to advisory-only
- **Owner**: Artifacts Agent (Phase 3)
- **Status**: Planned for Day 3

**Risk 4: macOS Compatibility**
- **Issue**: GNU timeout not on default macOS
- **Mitigation**: Native retry_with_backoff() function
- **Owner**: Artifacts Agent (Phase 4)
- **Status**: Planned for Day 4

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

**When Jesse Starts Next Tier-1 Session**:
1. Validate voice greeting auto-trigger (ARCH-BOOT-001c)
2. Test text fallback if voice services down
3. Review Phase 1 completion status
4. Approve parallel execution strategy
5. Confirm Phase 2 readiness (agent spawn sequence)
