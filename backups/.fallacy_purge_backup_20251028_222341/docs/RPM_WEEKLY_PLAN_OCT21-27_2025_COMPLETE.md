# RPM WEEKLY PLAN — OCTOBER 21-27, 2025
## **LIV HANA COGNITIVE ORCHESTRATION + $125K-175K REVENUE RECOVERY**
### "One Shot, One Kill — Autonomous Execution Week"

**CLASSIFICATION:** TIER 1 ABSOLUTE STANDARD  
**OWNER:** Jesse Niesen (CEO)  
**VERSION:** 3.0 (COMPLETE FUSED MASTER)  
**DATE:** Tuesday, October 21, 2025  
**STATUS:** 🔴 CRITICAL EXECUTION WEEK

---

## 🎯 RESULT (What We're Achieving This Week)

### **PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:**

1. **$125K-175K Revenue Recovery COMPLETE** — Veriff replacement (Jumio biometric) deployed via autonomous Cursor + Replit execution, 80+ blocked customers recovered, win-back campaign executed ($100K+ Veriff unlock + $25K-50K email/SMS recovery)

2. **DSHS Compliance Remediation DOCUMENTED** — Smokable hemp products relabeled, accredited COAs obtained, safety testing complete, 30-day deadline met, $1.148M annual revenue protected

3. **Liv Hana Cognitive Orchestration OPERATIONAL** — Voice-activated RPM planning workflow functional across 3 environments (Agent Builder, Replit, Cloud Run), hands-free execution <5 minutes per session

4. **HNC Content Pipeline AUTONOMOUS** — Days 15-21 parallel generation operational (7 episodes/week via Suno + Runway + ElevenLabs), brand awareness → traffic → R&D sales conversion

5. **Domain Consolidation Phase 2 COMPLETE** — 301 redirects live for 69-domain portfolio, reggieanddro.com canonical, SEO authority consolidated

---

### **BREAKTHROUGH METRICS:**

- **Revenue Impact:** $125K-175K total unlock (Veriff + win-back)
- **Profit Contribution:** $75K-130K net (60-80% margin after COGS)
- **Cognitive Load Reduction:** 6+ hours/week offloaded to AI (Jesse freed for strategy)
- **Execution Velocity:** RPM plan generation <5 minutes (vs 2-4 hour baseline)
- **Autonomous Execution:** 70-80% automation across critical path tasks
- **December Profit Target Progress:** 75-130% of $100K PROFIT target achieved this week alone

---

## 💪 PURPOSE (Why This Matters)

### **Strategic Imperatives:**

1. **Revenue Recovery NOW:** $100K+ locked revenue from Veriff failure represents immediate cash flow unlock—autonomous Cursor + Replit execution delivers Jumio integration in 6-12 hours (NOT weeks), enabling December $100K PROFIT target breakthrough

2. **Compliance Protection:** DSHS violations (June 17, 2025 inspection) threaten $1.148M annual revenue stream—30-day remediation deadline approaching October 26, must document corrective actions to avoid regulatory shutdown

3. **Cognitive Orchestration Breakthrough:** Voice mode + 9-model cognitive swarm collapses human timeframes (weeks→hours) via autonomous multi-model coordination, enabling Jesse to focus on high-leverage strategy instead of operational execution

4. **Mission Alignment:** Every recovered dollar funds the North Star mission to "Deschedule Cannabis sativa L entirely" — Texas leads global model of freedom, liberty, prosperity

5. **Team Empowerment:** Full-stack automation enables Andrew (Operations), Christopher (Culture/Payroll), and Charlie (Procurement) to operate with AI co-pilots, maximizing team leverage

### **Rally Cries:**
- "Grow baby grow and sell baby sell"
- "Grow, Sell, Heal"
- "Stay TOONED"
- "One Shot, One Kill"

## 🚀 MASSIVE ACTION PLAN

### **🔴 PRIORITY 1: VERIFF REPLACEMENT → JUMIO BIOMETRIC INTEGRATION**
**Owner:** Jesse + Cursor + Replit Agent (autonomous execution)  
**Timeline:** 6-12 hours parallel workflow  
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL — $100K+ revenue unlock  
**Profit Contribution:** $60K-80K net (60-80% margin)

#### **Autonomous Execution Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Jumio API Integration (Hours 1-4)**
```bash
# Cursor autonomous scaffold:
1. Read Jumio API documentation autonomously
2. Generate age verification integration code
3. Deploy custom frontend (LightSpeed integration)
4. Test biometric verification flow
5. Implement fallback mechanisms
```

**Phase 2: LightSpeed Integration (Hours 5-8)**
```bash
# Replit Agent 3 autonomous execution:
1. Connect Jumio webhook to LightSpeed checkout
2. Configure age gate triggers
3. Test full checkout flow (cart → verify → payment)
4. Deploy staging environment
5. Run compliance validation
```

**Phase 3: Production Deployment (Hours 9-12)**
```bash
# Cloud Run deployment:
1. Push Jumio frontend to production
2. Update DNS routing (reggieanddro.com)
3. Monitor first 10 transactions
4. Document compliance audit trail
5. Notify 80+ blocked customers (win-back campaign)
```

#### **Evidence-Based Timeframe:**
- **Human fallacy:** "Weeks to integrate Jumio"
- **Autonomous reality:** Sonnet 4.5 (77.2% SWE-bench, 30+ hour autonomy) + Replit Agent 3 parallel execution = 6-12 hours deployment
- **Verification:** Web search confirms frontier model API integration capabilities

#### **Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Jumio biometric verification functional
- ✅ 80+ blocked customers notified
- ✅ First $10K revenue flowing within 24 hours
- ✅ $100K+ revenue unlocked within 7 days

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION & CONTINGENCY PLANNING

### **RISK 1: Jumio Integration Delays**
**Probability:** LOW (15%)  
**Impact:** HIGH ($100K+ revenue delay)  
**Mitigation:**
- Parallel execution (Cursor + Replit simultaneous development)
- Fallback: Manual ID verification (temporary, 24-48 hour bridge)
- Escalation: Engage Jumio support (priority enterprise support)

### **RISK 2: DSHS Non-Compliance Penalties**
**Probability:** MEDIUM (30%)  
**Impact:** CRITICAL ($1.148M revenue shutdown)  
**Mitigation:**
- Early submission (October 25, 1 day buffer before deadline)
- Legal review (Andrea Steel validation)
- Evidence documentation (photos, COAs, inventory screenshots)
- Escalation: Follow-up call to Nicole Palmer (confirmation of receipt)

### **RISK 3: Customer Win-Back Campaign Low Response**
**Probability:** MEDIUM (40%)  
**Impact:** MEDIUM ($25K-50K revenue miss)  
**Mitigation:**
- Multi-channel outreach (email + SMS)
- Time-limited offer (15% off code expires in 7 days)
- Personalized messaging (Jesse's voice, authentic apology)
- Escalation: Campaign 3 (phone call outreach to high-value customers)

### **RISK 4: HNC Content Production Delays**
**Probability:** LOW (20%)  
**Impact:** LOW (brand awareness delay, no immediate revenue impact)  
**Mitigation:**
- Parallel autonomous generation (Suno + Runway + ElevenLabs)
- Pre-scripted episodes (HNC Master Canvas library)
- Flexible scheduling (publish when ready, not forced daily)
- Escalation: Shift to 5/week cadence temporarily

### **RISK 5: Domain Consolidation Technical Issues**
**Probability:** LOW (10%)  
**Impact:** MEDIUM (temporary SEO ranking volatility)  
**Mitigation:**
- Test 5 sample domains before full deployment
- Monitor redirect analytics (24-48 hours post-deployment)
- Preserve query strings (SEO best practice)
- Escalation: Rollback redirects if 404 errors detected

- 7-day execution breakdown with daily priorities
- Role-specific training integration
- KPI dashboard with financial/operational/content metrics
- Risk mitigation strategies with contingency planning
- Communication protocols (daily stand-up, weekly debrief, emergency escalation)

### **Decisions:**
- **Priority 1:** Veriff replacement (Cursor + Replit autonomous execution, 6-12 hour timeframe, NOT weeks)
- **Priority 2:** DSHS compliance deadline (October 25 submission, 1 day buffer)
- **Priority 3:** Customer win-back campaign (80+ customers, 15% off code, $25K-50K recovery)
- **Priority 4:** HNC content pipeline (Days 15-21 autonomous generation, 7 episodes/week)
- **Priority 5:** Domain consolidation (69 domains → 4 canonical targets, SEO authority preservation)

### **Memory Updates:**
- Veriff replacement critical path clarified (autonomous execution, 6-12 hour timeframe)
- DSHS compliance deadline confirmed (October 26, submission target October 25)
- Customer win-back campaign details finalized (80+ customers, 15% off code, $25K-50K recovery)
- HNC autonomous production workflow documented (Suno + Runway + ElevenLabs parallel execution)
- Domain consolidation 301 redirect plan confirmed (cloudflare_bulk_redirects.csv ready for upload)

### **Next Best Steps:**
1. **Immediate (Today):** Jesse briefs Cursor + Replit on Jumio integration kickoff
2. **Tuesday Morning:** Andrew launches customer win-back campaign (9:00am send)
3. **Wednesday Morning:** Charlie delivers KCA Labs samples (compliance testing)

5. **Friday Morning:** Jesse submits DSHS compliance response (deadline October 26)
6. **Friday Afternoon:** Team weekly debrief + Week 2 RPM planning (3:00pm Zoom)

### **Risks:**
- **Jumio integration delays** (mitigated by parallel Cursor + Replit execution)
- **DSHS non-compliance penalties** (mitigated by early submission, legal review, evidence documentation)
- **Customer win-back low response** (mitigated by multi-channel outreach, time-limited offer, personalized messaging)

### **Token Usage:**
~120K tokens consumed (project knowledge synthesis + document generation)  
~70K tokens remaining for follow-up questions and refinement
