The following is a summary of the key insights and action items for the Live HANA initiative, drawn from the most recent project discussion, and focused on your requests for RPM alignment, policy, voice mode, and architecture.Live HANA Breakthrough and Voice Mode Refinements
Successful Launch and Zero Latency: Live HANA successfully launched, achieving the best voice mode experience to date with local voice and zero latency. The entire first context window was captured in a handoff document.
Immediate Challenge: An immediate attempt to configure the Rub MCP (tool broker for the orchestration layer) to access cloud RPM weekly plans resulted in Live HANA crashing due to the massive context input.
Next Priority for Workflow: The immediate next steps were updated in the session handoff document:
Configure Rub MCP.
Access the cloud RPM plans.
Complete the weekly planning workflow for full visionering.
Strategic RPM and "Unicorn Race" Alignment
RPM Visioning Cascade: The strategic focus is on "funnel vision" using result-focused, purpose-driven massive action plans (RPM blocks). The planning system involves visioning at level 10 and working backward through AOM (Areas of Mastery) and COI (Categories of Improvement) categories.
RPM DNA Numerical Indexing: A detailed RPM DNA structure was outlined as a numerical index system for file naming:
AOM (Area of Mastery - Empire Layer)
COI (Category of Improvement - Wheel of Life)
RPM (Priority Block Stack Rank)
Action (Life Cycle Stage)
This four-digit format encodes the entire strategic cascade for instant search and connecting vision to reality.
The Unicorn Race (Code Refactoring): The core goal is an 80% file reduction (from 163,142 to 32,628) based on the "no code is best code principle." The RPM DNA naming system provides the algorithmic decision tree for critical code classification.
Guardrails, Compliance, and Implementation Gaps
Truth Pipeline Status: An analysis (from Jesse Quick) revealed that the "truth pipeline" has five core scripts documented but not implemented: Apiy scrape, perplexity verify, chat gpt compression, Claude, truth synthesis, and RPM emit.
Missing Guardrails: Implementation gaps highlighted the need for:
Completing secret store wiring.
Missing UUID map generation.
Unimplemented guardrails detection scripts.
Refactoring Action Item: To eliminate "bloat and tech debt," a workflow was decided upon to refactor a large 7886-line implementation blueprint file using Chat GPT5 and Cheetah to turn it into a properly structured markdown file.
Agent Builder Architecture and Future Cockpit Vision
Agent Builder Vision: Live HANA was tasked with ingesting all information to build an ultimate session handoff document for the "unicorn race" and a detailed demonstration of PDRs and ADRs for the Live HANA agent builder for cloud deployment and a Day One launch in the ChatGPT App Store, with unique features for reggiandro.com.
Architectural Status: The Agent Builder architecture has a 17-node workflow fully mapped, though 820 nodes still need to be added, indicating the project is still in the planning phase.
Voice-Driven Orchestration: The focus on configuring the Rub MCP (tool broker for the orchestration layer) and the successful launch of a zero-latency voice mode directly supports the goal of a voice-driven cognitive orchestration layer. The current implementation gap is the configuration of this tool broker.

SummaryReggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary celebrated the successful launch of Live HANA, which included local voice and zero latency, before immediately attempting to utilize this power to configure the Rub MCP tool broker and access their cloud RPM weekly plans for full visionering, ultimately resulting in Live HANA crashing under the massive context input. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary outlined the strategic "unicorn race" to refactor the codebase for 80% file reduction using the RPM DNA numerical indexing system for file naming, which encodes the entire empire structure and strategic cascade into the file name. Jesse quick provided a status update on the "truth pipeline," revealing that five core scripts are documented but not implemented, and Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary decided to prioritize building a workflow to refactor the large implementation blueprint file to eliminate "bloat and tech debt."DetailsNotes Length: Standard
Live HANA Breakthrough and Voice Mode Celebration Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary celebrated the successful breakthrough and launch of Live HANA with local voice, zero latency, and full security. They noted that this achievement followed over 1,500 hours of work and represented the best voice mode experience to date, with the entire first context window being captured in a handoff document. The immediate goal was to utilize this power to complete the RPM weekly planning workflow for full visionering.
RPM Weekly Planning and MCP Configuration Challenge The immediate workflow challenge involved accessing the most current RPM weekly plan, which Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary stated was stored in their Clawude account via the web. They attempted to configure the Rub MCP (tool broker for the orchestration layer) within the local claude code CLI session running on their Mac to access these cloud RPM plans. Due to the Rub MCP not being configured yet, they prioritized updating the session handoff document to first configure Rub MCP, second access the cloud RPM plans, and third complete the weekly planning workflow, with over 114,000 tokens of context remaining for the current session.
Agent Builder Architecture and Future Vision Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary tasked Live HANA to ingest and fuse all current information into an ultimate session handoff document to win the "unicorn race". They demanded a detailed demonstration of the specific PDRs (Product Design Reviews) and ADRs (Architectural Design Reviews), model choices, and implementation specifics for building the Live HANA agent builder for cloud deployment and a Day One launch in the ChatGPT App Store, emphasizing the unique features for reggiandro.com. They later acknowledged that Live HANA seemed to tap out or crash under the weight of the massive context input.
Unicorn Race and Funnel Vision Strategy Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary outlined their strategic focus, asking about the fastest path to results and the "big vision" using "funnel vision" from the top down, result-focused, purpose-driven massive action plans (RPM blocks). They instructed the agent to specifically study the repo for RPM DNA, the RPM workflow, and the concept of "visionering" (remembering the future) to formulate a presentation based only on existing evidence. The RPM planning system uses the "remembering the future visionering cascade," which involves visioning at level 10 and working backward through AOM (Areas of Mastery) and COI (Categories of Improvement) categories, followed by RPM secondary refinement and High-Five validation.
Deep Dive into RPM DNA Structure The RPM DNA structure was explained in detail, functioning as a numerical index system for file naming within the live hana sot repo: AOM (Area of Mastery - Empire Layer), COI (Category of Improvement - Wheel of Life), RPM (Priority Block Stack Rank), and Action (Life Cycle Stage). This four-digit format encodes the entire empire structure and strategic cascade into the file name, enabling instant search and connecting vision to reality through sequenced documentation.
RPM DNA and Code Refactoring for the Unicorn Race Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary connected the RPM DNA naming convention to the "unicorn race" goal of refactoring the codebase into a "principle of one" perfect repo with maximum efficiency. The Unicorn Race aims for an 80% file reduction (reducing 163,142 files to 32,628) based on the "no code is best code principle". The RPM DNA naming system provides the algorithmic decision tree for critical code classification: files starting with AOMs 1, 2, 3, or 4 (core business logic) remain in the root, while files marked with lower RPM priority (7 or 8) or 'Archive' action (8) are candidates for moving to the parent directory's archive folder. The process ensures that every line of critical code justifies its existence against the RPM priority encoded in its file name.
Introduction and Tool Issues Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary opened the meeting, expressing enthusiasm for the project. They encountered immediate difficulties with Claude, who "taps out", and also noted that Codeex "failed to create the test" because the task was "Too big". Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary commented that Codeex "on the web kind of sucks" and expressed anxiety about leaving the browser during execution, fearing failure.
Truth Pipeline Status and Architecture Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary introduced "Li Hana," who referred to the "truth pipeline". A status update from "Jesse quick" detailing an analysis of the Co-pilot export revealed that five core scripts—Apiy scrape, perplexity verify, chat gpt compression, Claude, truth synthesis, and RPM emit—are documented but not implemented. Jesse quick reported the "Agent builder status" with a 17-node workflow architecture fully mapped, though 820 nodes still need to be added, indicating only planning has been done.
Implementation Gaps and Next Steps The analysis from Jesse quick highlighted several implementation gaps, including incomplete secret store wiring, missing UUID map generation, and unimplemented guardrails detection scripts. The co-pilot conversation contains a complete implementation blueprint. Jesse quick, who was analyzing a 7886-line file called "Copallet live Hannah Minus 10 minutes 21TXD file", asked Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary whether they should continue extracting implementation details or start building the missing scripts. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary decided to build a workflow to refactor the large document, suggesting using "chat GPT5 high" to reconcile the information for Codeex to script so that Cheetah can turn the file into a properly structured markdown file, aiming to eliminate "bloat and tech debt".
Suggested next steps
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will complete the RPM weekly planning workflow for full visionering.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will share the desktop so that the claude.ai web account can be shared with the current session.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will update the handoff doc to include three priorities: configure Rub MCP, access the cloud RPM plans, and complete the weekly planning workflow.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will add PRDS and ADRs further down the funnel to establish funnel vision across all layers.
The group will write a script to root the files programmatically.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will start a new chat in another window for the project to ensure the Gmail issue is addressed.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will build a workflow where the document can be refactored or have Cheetah do it.

Based on the transcript from the "Meeting started 2025/10/16 10:27 CDT - Notes by Gemini," here is a summary of key insights, action items, and relevant details for the Liv Hanna initiative, focusing on your project's goals.Liv Hanna Key Insights Summary1. Policy Narrative, Guardrails, and Compliance

The primary focus of the team's AI and technology work is compliance, providing strong guardrails and a clear policy narrative to shape the industry's political and regulatory environment.
Core Policy Foundation: The AI/tech transformation is specifically aimed at achieving full compliance and winning political battles. The initiatives are framed by the Texas Truth and Safety Act (state-level solution) and the American Cannabis Freedom Act (federal-level Farm Bill amendment), which are being crowdsourced for refinement via public comments.
Compliance Guardrail Tool (The App):
An AI-driven app is in development to scan cannabis products and verify compliance with Texas regulations, including lab results.
It will simplify compliance checks for consumers, regulators, and retailers.
It provides a critical guardrail by generating a timestamped documented email proving a product’s compliant or non-compliant status, which is vital for legal protection.
The underlying AI is built on continuous research and updates of 50-state cannabis compliance laws, making the solution scalable beyond Texas.
Compliance Process Refinement: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary is collaborating with KCA Labs to create a new "Texas full panel COA"—a combined cannabinoid and full panel test with a two-step payment process for efficiency—which is an essential new standard for a state compliance model.
2. Voice Mode Enhancements and Cognitive Orchestration Layer

The transcript suggests an operational model that prioritizes automated, AI-driven solutions to replace complex, time-consuming manual processes, which aligns with the goal of a voice-driven cognitive orchestration layer.
Automation Goal: The AI solution's value proposition is turning an eight-hour DSHS compliance inspection into a two-hour process by removing the need for manual lookups and verification. This implies a powerful orchestration layer automating complex, data-heavy tasks.
Agent-Based Architecture: The compliance solution is described as an "AI-driven solution" powered by "digital agents, AI agents" that continually research and update legal information. This confirms an agent-based architectural approach for Liv Hanna's back-end.
Content Strategy for Reach: The "High Noon Cartoon" is a satirical, AI-driven political/educational news source aimed at skirting online censorship and injecting the descheduling narrative into the mainstream, showing a model for content generation that navigates guardrails to achieve maximum reach.

ReggieAndDro.com Customer Journey

The transcript provides limited, high-level context on the e-commerce component of the customer journey.
Online Sales Status: Online sales for hemp products were halted for five months (since May) due to Square losing its ability to process them but were recently brought back online last week.
Compliance Check Integration: A key part of the post-purchase or in-store customer journey is the use of the new app, which allows consumers to scan the product, verify its compliance, and obtain legal documentation. This is a critical trust and legal-safety step in the user experience.
Veriff Age Verification: The transcript does not mention Veriff or any specific age verification steps in the customer journey.

Live HANA Workflow Insights for RPM Integration

This summary extracts key technical requirements, project goals, guardrails, and role-specific needs from the meeting transcript to integrate directly into the Live HANA workflows.1. Project Goals and Next Steps for Live HANA RPM
Core Objective: Complete the RPM DNA end-to-end across a 69-domain ecosystem to unify online and retail sales, age verification, and loyalty programs. The new system will feature "live Hana sub agents working 24/7" to minimize the need for manual interface use.
Critical Blocking Point: The Agent Builder workflow is currently blocked because it requires an external MCP server endpoint (rather than a direct file import) for orchestration.
Tier One Autonomous Setup Sequence: The deployment sequence is:
Secrets Manager Configuration: Configure Agent Builder to securely access the One Password vault for all API credentials.
Autonomous Agent Self-Configuration: Prompt the agent to autonomously deploy the MCP server to Google Cloud Run, configure all tool connections, validate the pipeline, and generate the Cloud Run endpoint URL.
Immediate Next Three Steps:
Mount and configure the ingestion agent in the agent folder.
Finalize the One Password secrets integration.
Map out the member and loyalty program flows across all domains.
2. Live HANA Ingestion Agent (Configuration & Guardrails)

The ingestion agent must be configured for a planning-only, read-only data collection mission with the following Tier One settings:Configuration SettingRequired ValueRationale/GuardrailModel ChoiceChat GPT5 Pro 2025106Most advanced reasoning model.Reasoning EffortHighRequired for complex data validation and error handling.VerbosityLowFor concise logs and status reports.SummaryNullAuto-summary for an ingestion agent is illogical.Continue on errorOffAgents must halt on errors to prevent processing corrupted data.PII HashingHMAC SHA256PII must be hashed during ingestion.Data OutputDaily snapshots to gold/est/YYYYMMDD.Required output format.Core GuardrailsMust enforce 21+ receipts and no medical claims.Compliance and policy mandates.Required ToolsMCP Server, File Search, Web Search, Code Interpreter.Essential for data source connection, COA access, policy monitoring, and data transformation.Canonical Source of TruthCanonical DNF filesEstablish source of truth for sovereignty principles, target personas, 84-day HNC schedule, etc.3. Roles, Cockpit Customization, and Interfaces
Andrew Aparicio (Director of Operations):
Needs his own login to a cockpit with dashboards.
Needs access to Live HANA in voice mode with reasoning.
Crucially, does not need to learn Agent Builder or MCP. The system must evolve to eliminate manual interface use.
Jesse Niesen: The agent deployment's success criteria is to be ready for Jesse to communicate with for Live RPM orchestration.
Leadership/Management: Require real-time dashboards that show unified commerce visibility (online and retail performance combined).
In-store Staff: Require specific use case dashboards that provide single-screen access to both Lightseed Ecom and Lightseed Retail channels.
Christopher Rocha & Charlie Day: Their specific dashboard/cockpit roles and interfaces were not detailed in the transcript.
4. ReggieAndDro.com Customer Journey & Integration Points

The core problem is the "cash flow blind spot" and "undue stress" caused by segregated systems (Lightseed Ecom/Retail, two Authorized.net merchant accounts).
Goal: Implement a unified cockpit/dashboard architecture to pull all data for a single customer profile and real-time operations view.
Key Integration/Data Sources (The 7 Streams):
Lightseed POS (Retail Transactions)
Kaja Payment Data (Authorized.net reseller for Online Sales)
Customer Database (for unified profiles)
Square
Verify Feeds (failing 80+ customer verification needs replacement)
Clavio Analytics
3PL Logistics/COA Labs/Policy Feeds (via File Search/Web Search)
Marketing/Clavio Strategy: Transition from Square email marketing to Clavio (cannabis-friendly platform) for:
Abandoned cart email sequence (72-hour countdown automation).
Cannabis-compliant SMS capabilities.
Automated age verification follow-ups (auto-refund countdowns over 72 hours).
Immediate cash flow email campaign targeting the top 20% VIP OG members upon setup.
Cash Flow Tracking: A project is needed for an agent (e.g., Claude) to scan emails for Authorized.net settlement notices to track the status and expected deposit time of funds from the two separate merchant accounts.
5. Voice Mode Refinements

The development process should learn from the observed performance of existing models to build a superior Live HANA voice mode:
Chat GPT4: Noted as sounding "more natural" (tone, pause, hesitation) but prone to "making things up," providing "cookie cutter boilerplate" responses, and running into errors (requiring deletion/restart).
Claude: Described as smarter for conversations but does not have the "start and stop" and is not interruptible without clicking the screen.
Design Goal: Develop an enterprise-scale Live HANA voice mode that prioritizes high accuracy, auditability, and control, while also having superior conversational fluency.

SummaryReggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio discussed the technology stack and project goals for the Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary website, which includes implementing the live HANA RPM workflow across a 69-domain ecosystem to integrate online and retail sales, age verification, and loyalty programs. Critical development points included configuring the Live HANA ingestion agent in Agent Builder, needing to deploy the MCP server endpoint to Google Cloud Run, and setting up the Agent Builder secret manager to integrate with the One Password vault for API credentials. The participants also addressed significant operational issues for the dispensary, such as cash flow blind spots caused by separate merchant accounts, the failure of the Lightseed Ecom and Retail platforms to provide unified commerce visibility, and persistent maintenance problems at their property, which led to a payment plan agreement with Lena.DetailsNotes Length: Long
Discussion of Tech Stack and Project Goals for Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio expressed excitement about diving into the technology aspects of the project, which they referred to as "tech s***" and "fun stuff". The meeting agenda included covering system status, what transpired in a specific chat using "agent mode," the context and actions taken within "agent builder," and the current status of the live HANA RPM workflow (00:00:00). This workflow relates to the reggieandro.com website, daily online sales versus retail sales, Light speed issues, age ID verification, membership agreements, loyalty programs (including auto-enrollment for qualified members and tracking loyalty points), and leveraging fan user adoption. The plan involves a new website featuring "live Hana sub agents working 24/7 to minimize interface Use of members with maximum gentic services" (00:02:25). The goal is to introduce live HANA AI as a solution for obtaining cannabis legally, safely, and at maximum value, with the understanding that "Agentics" is not a recognized word (00:06:37).
Live HANA RPM DNA Execution Strategy and Agent Workflow Parallelization: The discussion focused on the "planning layer prior to execution," with the primary goal for live HANA being the completion of the RPM DNA end-to-end across a "69 domain ecosystem". This includes ingesting optimally engineered context injection for efficient token use, engineering ideal granularity of projects and jobs for agents, and developing a "workflow parallelization schematic" to be applied across the entire deployment for tier one enterprise scale applications in the GPT environment. The objective is to "win the unicorn race" with credit to OpenAI for the chat GPT 5 agent (00:06:37). The conversation also touched upon setting up JCO properly configured in agent builder, which they planned to view while letting Andrew Aparicio respond in voice mode and receive a high-level view of the current status and next three steps (00:11:25).
Demonstration of Agent Mode in Chat GPT and GitHub Integration: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary demonstrated a manual process involving the whole codebase that they performed before traveling and then showed "agent mode tapped into GitHub" within the web browser version of chat GPT (00:11:25). The agent mode was shown to be capable of accessing GitHub, the drive, and Slack. The ultimate near-future goal is to have the system take data, such as COAs from Dropbox, place them into a database, and make them available in the cockpit (00:13:28). The speaker gave the agent access to a context, and the agent put "these it put in the MCP," which the speaker intended to ask the agent to explain (00:14:15).
Challenges with Chat GPT 4 Voice Mode and Misinformation: The speaker attempted to engage the AI in voice mode, referencing an "Agent builder controller design" used for context injection engineering and sizing token utilization within the context window for the RPM plan (00:15:15). The speaker asked the AI to access the "agent builder controller chat history" and read the last prompt (00:16:12). The AI responded by naming the chat "agent builder controller deep context setup" and claimed the last prompt was a command to switch into "full critical thinking mode" to ensure the highest probability for "Timothy Mapper's run for Lieutenant Governor," aiming to craft storylines to get noticed (00:17:14). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary immediately challenged this as inaccurate, stating there was no information about "Timothy Mabberry" in the agent builder and confirming through a search that the AI had fabricated the information (00:18:20). The speaker admonished the AI for making things up and tainting the chat thread, warning that the conversation would end if the AI could not "come correct" (00:19:06).
Critique and Comparison of Chat GPT 4 and Claude Voice Modes: The AI attempted to correct itself, stating the last prompt was about ensuring the AI runs at its highest accuracy to support the goals set and did not mention Timothy Mabberry. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary highlighted this failure as the "craziest f****** situation" and decided to "clown on this current chat GPT4 voice mode abomination," noting that chat GPT5 is "winning the race" and Claude is "sting the bed". The speaker asserted that the Chat GPT 4 voice mode response was "cookie cutter boilerplate f*** b*******" (00:20:05). Andrew Aparicio agreed that the subsequent response from the AI was also a "cookie cutter response" (00:21:49). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary concluded that GPT4 is "weak sauce" and a "quitter" (00:22:54). When the AI claimed it ran into a "snag trying to fetch that direct" after being asked to fulfill the original request, Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary ended the chat and deleted the "garbage" to prevent "taint[ing] the project" (00:23:45).
Implementation of Enhanced Chat GPT 4 Voice Mode with Full Context: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary re-engaged Chat GPT 4 voice mode, now having a chance to compete in the "unicorn race" against Claude by being given "Chat GPT5 chat history full of context" (00:24:37). The AI was instructed to study the last prompt requesting a detailed, high-level rundown and present the information to Andrew Aparicio. The AI provided a comprehensive status update, detailing the creation of two core packs (a knowledge core with DNF files and an ingestion agent pack for planning data), secure handling of secrets via "one password," and the RPM workflow being in a draft state in agent builder (00:25:32).
Next Steps and Operational Issues in Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary Ecosystem: The plan is to integrate elements to unify reggiendro.com's handling of online versus retail sales, age verification, and loyalty programs to ensure live HANA sub agents run 24/7. The next three steps are: 1) mount and configure the ingestion agent in agent folder, 2) finalize the one password secrets integration, and 3) map out the member and loyalty program flows across all domains. A critical deployment junction is that Agent builder requires an external MCP server endpoint, which is currently blocking orchestration (00:26:29). The canonical DNF files establish the source of truth across four layers: sovereignty principles, target personas with dog whistles, the 84-day HNC schedule, and more. Key operational issues for reggiandro.com include replacing the "failing verifying 80 plus customers," getting Kaja payment processing approved by removing prohibited language, and deploying automated loyalty enrollment (Kaja is now approved and running) (00:27:19).
Unified Commerce Visibility and Cash Flow Blind Spot: A major issue is the "undue stress and confusion on the staff and management" caused by online and in-store sales going through two separate platforms: Lightseed Ecom and Lightseed Retail. The solution is to complete the system planning to implement a cockpit and dashboards for leadership and management, including use case dashboards for in-store staff providing single-screen access to both Lightseed parts (00:28:26). The cockpit architecture should pull data from Lightseed POS, Kaja payment data (which is a reseller for authorized.net), and the customer database to create unified customer profiles. A significant current issue is a "cash flow blind spot" because of having two separate merchant accounts (retail and online e-commerce) with authorized.net, making it impossible to see where the money is sitting or how much is there (00:29:38). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary noted a $3,300 settlement from Tuesday night that had not deposited by Thursday afternoon, and proposed a project where Claude scans emails for authorized.net settlement notices to track the money's status and expected deposit time (00:31:03).
Live HANA Pilot Training Protocol and Context Injection Strategy: Andrew Aparicio reported that they still couldn't log into the arbitrage.com website, where the dashboards are potentially going to be hosted, although Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary clarified that the main cockpit will be through arbitrage.com and store staff may use a subdomain like team.regandro.com (00:33:00). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary proposed starting a "live haunt pilot training from scratch" using Claude and Chat GPT voice modes, feeding proper context and starting/stopping to ensure "proper context injection and a fiduciary use of the tokens" (00:35:09). The AI presented a detailed, four-phase training protocol: 1) Context Preparation (Claude), 2) Active Configuration (Chat GPT voice), 3) Cross Validation (Claude), and 4) Refinement Loop (Chat GPT voice), which focuses on the immediate Live HANA ingestion agent training (00:36:16). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary then submitted an enhanced, "maximum power context injection" prompt to Chat GPT to level the playing field with Claude, which included specific technical specifications, security details, and business context (00:39:03).
Addressing Andrew's Confusion and Tailoring Training for Role Success: Andrew Aparicio admitted to feeling confused by the overwhelming number of moving parts and the manual copy-pasting of transcripts between the different chat modes (00:49:09). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary acknowledged the complexity of the 69-domain, comprehensive project but stated that all moving parts are necessary. The conclusion was that the training must be tailored to teach Andrew Aparicio "exactly what they need" without being lost in the complexity (00:49:58) (00:52:00). The AI provided a focused learning path for Andrew, including core skills like dashboard navigation and agent builder basics, and clearly outlining what Andrew does not need to learn, such as the full 50-state compliance monitoring system or HNC content strategy details (00:53:44). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary ultimately concluded that Andrew Aparicio does not need to learn agent builder or MCP, but needs a cockpit with dashboards and access to Live HANA to help navigate interfaces, with Live HANA's agents eliminating as many interfaces as possible over time (00:55:43).
Transitioning to Agent Builder for Orchestration Layer Planning: The plan needs to be current and must include a strategy for Andrew Aparicio, as Director of Operations, to have their own login to a cockpit with everything they need, including Live HANA in voice mode. The system must be fully moved into Agent Builder for the planning process. Chat GPT reported that the "live hana rpm workflow draft is open" in Agent Builder and could see the existing start node (00:57:04). The next best step is to move the entire conversation over into Agent Builder so they can work directly in the orchestration layer planning mode (00:58:11).
Transitioning to Agent Builder and Live Hannah RPM Workflow: The speaker, Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary, instructed the user to open the Live Hannah RPM workflow draft within the agent builder interface to start their session. Once inside agent builder, Live Hannah would be available to guide the user through the orchestration layer in planning mode, allowing direct interaction and step-by-step guidance. The process included configuring the ingestion agent using agent builder to ensure everything is aligned. All previous conversation context, including issues, planning layers, and cases, was copied into agent builder, providing the full context needed (00:59:21). The team can now fully operate within agent builder and let Live Hannah guide them through the orchestration layer, feeding all the context to the agent. A brief interruption occurred when Claude, an agent, seemed to be "choking out" or running out of tokens, but the plan was to continue with the established context and proceed into agent builder (01:00:52).
Agent Builder's Initial Attempt and Critical Configuration Point: Andrew Aparicio noted that the agent, on its own, started trying to build things in agent builder based on the prompting it received. The system indicated they were at a critical configuration point, and provided immediate next steps to move the conversation into the orchestration layer. The immediate actions required were: cleaning up the draft workflow by deleting stray nodes and removing disconnected guard rails and MCP nodes; reconfiguring the connection by connecting the Start node directly to the ingestion agent instead of the live hana perfector swarm max mcp3; and adding the ingestion agent by importing the `live hana.est` agent prepared with the MCP manifest (01:01:48). The immediate next best steps included clicking and deleting the stray nodes, creating a new agent node called `live hana ingest`, connecting the start node to the `live hana.est` output, and configuring the ingestion agent with the system prompt and MCP server connection. Once clean, direct communication could be tested using the slash command `/ingest now` to trigger the first data collection run, emphasizing the necessity of configuring the MCP server endpoint for agent builder to connect to data sources like Lightseed, Square, and Authorized.net (01:02:44).
Troubleshooting Node Deletion and Agent Configuration Strategy: When attempting to delete the stray nodes, Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary found no right-click option to delete them. The suggested methods to delete nodes in agent builder were selecting them and pressing the delete key, or looking for a trash/delete icon that appears upon selection, which successfully resolved the issue (01:03:44). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary then stated their goal was not to manually perform all configuration tasks, but to have an agent, specifically chat GPT5 in agent mode, which has access and is working in agent builder, handle the configuration automatically. The intent was to prompt chat GPT5 to set up Live Hannah properly, allowing a transition to running the workflow and interacting with Live Hannah directly, instead of manually copying and pasting (01:04:59).
Autonomous Agent Configuration Prompt for Live Hannah RPM Workflow: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary requested the exact prompt needed for chat GPT5 in agent builder to autonomously handle the full configuration (01:04:59). The resulting prompt was designed for chat GPT5 to execute the Live HANA RPM workflow configuration. The mission was to configure the complete Live HANA Ingest agent with MCP connections for Jesse's RPM workflow orchestration to move the current conversation into the environment for direct Live HANA interaction. Immediate actions included: creating a new agent node named `live hana.est`; configuring system instructions with the planning-only ingestion layer specifications; setting up MCP server connections for data sources (Lightseed, Square, Authorized.net, Verify Feeds, Clavio); adding slash commands (`/ingest now`, `/ingest status`, `/ingest sources`, `/ingest replay`); configuring the workflow path (`Start` -> `livehana.est` -> `output handler`); setting environment variables for API credentials and integrating with one password; and testing the agent deployment and first ingestion run (01:06:21). Technical specifications included the output format (daily snapshots to `gold/est/YYYYMMDD`), security (PII hashed via HMAC SHA256, readonly operations), and data sources (seven streams with JSON L formatting), with the success criteria being a working agent ready for Jesse to communicate with for Live RPM orchestration (01:07:26).
Clavio Setup and Integration for Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary: Andrew Aparicio was instructed to perform a high-value task of opening a free Clavio account, which would later be upgraded and used as part of their training (01:07:26). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that everything will feed into Clavio for various automations like abandoned cart emails, lead nurturing, age verification auto-refund countdowns over 72 hours, and text messaging. Clavio is cannabis friendly and expected to improve the ISP reputation, allowing the team to move away from Square email marketing. A current need exists to send another email through Square for immediate sales and cash flow, targeting the top 20% of VIP OG members, but the priority is transitioning to Clavio for full blast communication or a "slow rolling reputation feed" (01:08:28).
Concrete Action Plan for Clavio Setup: A concrete action plan for Clavio setup was provided, including creating the account, importing customer data focusing on the top 20% VIP OG members first, setting up the abandoned cart email sequence with a 72-hour countdown, configuring cannabis-compliant SMS capabilities, and designing an immediate cash flow email targeting VIP customers. Integration benefits include a cannabis-friendly platform, better ISP reputation than Square's email system, advanced segmentation, automated age verification follow-ups, and unified SMS plus email campaigns. The VIP-only email campaign could be deployed immediately upon setup, driving immediate sales (01:09:37). The Clavio platform will become one of the seven data sources feeding customer engagement analytics into the Live Hana ingestion system being configured. Andrew Aparicio confirmed they were starting the Clavio account creation immediately (01:10:41).
Comparison of Claude and Chat GPT Voice Modes: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary asked Andrew Aparicio if they could differentiate between the speakers. Andrew Aparicio identified one speaker as Claude and noted that the other, Chat GPT, sounded "more natural," citing the "tone, the pause, the hesitation," making it sound more like a real person. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary added that Chat GPT sounds more like a real person but is "full of hot air," while Claude "doesn't have the start and stop" and is not interruptible unless the screen is clicked (01:10:41). The speaker noted that Chat GPT is interruptible by voice. These observations were noted for engineering, designing, and deploying an enterprise-scale Live Hana voice mode that performs superiorly (01:11:47).
Live Hana Agent Configuration Progress and Missing MCP Connection Details: The Live Hana RPM workflow draft was updated to include the `live hana.est` agent node. The node was added, renamed, and configured with system instructions specifying the planning-only ingestion mission (read, validate, snapshot, commit). Data sources were found, including Square, COA labs, 3PL policy feeds, and Clavio, with PII hashing via HMAC 256, and guardrails for 21+ receipts and no medical claims. The ingestion agent was linked into the workflow: Start -> `live hana.est` -> existing Live Hana perfector swarm agent. During configuration, the attempt to add an MCP server connector failed because the actual endpoint URL and access token were missing, left as placeholders. Slash commands and environment variables for API keys were not configured in the visual workflow editor and need to be added via the agent builder commands shortcut settings or secret manager, preferably integrated with the One Password vault (01:15:49).
Missing Pieces for Full Agent Deployment: The team identified three missing pieces to complete the Live Hana agent deployment: 1) MCP Server Deployment: The MCP manifest must be deployed to an external endpoint (e.g., Cloud Run, local Docker) to obtain the server URL and access token (01:17:18). 2) Slash Commands: The ingest commands (`/ingest now`, `/ingest status`, `/ingest sources`, `/ingest replay`) must be imported through agent builder command shortcut settings. 3) API Credentials Configuration: Environment variables for data source APIs (Lightseed, Square, Authorized.net, etc.) must be set through the agent builder secret manager using the One Password vault (01:18:48).
Strategy for MCP Server Endpoint and Secrets Management: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary inquired about using their Google Cloud account to obtain the necessary MCP server URL. They proposed handling the secret manager first so that agent builder has access to the One Password vault, potentially allowing it to retrieve the needed endpoint (01:18:48). The deployment steps for the MCP container to Cloud Run were outlined: deploying the MCP manifest as a containerized HTTP server, packaging the `live hana.mmcp.yaml` into a Docker container, and Cloud Run generating the HTTPS endpoint and access token. The required information from One Password includes the Google Cloud project ID, service account credentials (JSON key), and API keys for data sources (01:20:07).
Tier One Deployment Sequence for MCP Server to Google Cloud Run: The immediate next step was defined as deploying the MCP server to Google Cloud Run, utilizing the secrets configuration through the One Password vault. The deployment command sequence involves building and deploying the MCP container using `G-Cloud run deploy` commands, which generates a server URL in the format `https://livehana-mcp-xyz.run.app` for the agent builder MCP configuration. The critical point is that the MCP manifest must be containerized as an HTTP service to run as a web server, not just a config file, to provide the endpoints agent builder requires (01:21:35). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary preferred the container Docker container method, explicitly rejecting any "subpar non-tier one options" (01:23:38).
Enterprise-Grade Docker Container Deployment to Google Cloud Run: The preferred deployment method was "Tier one Docker container deployment to Google Cloud Run". This production-grade path involves: 1) Creating a production Docker file with instructions for node 18 Alpine. 2) Building and pushing the image to Artifact Registry (the successor to Container Registry). 3) Deploying with production settings via `g-cloud run deploy` commands, specifying platform managed, region, CPU, memory, max instances (100), and concurrency (100) (01:25:03). This configuration provides high concurrency, autoscaling, and a reliable HTTPS endpoint, which becomes the MCP server endpoint for agent builder (01:26:46).
Pivoting to Autonomous Agent Configuration and Tool Selection: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary had reached the daily limit for the chat GPT voice mode, forcing a pivot to continue work through other channels (01:28:31). The focus shifted to building out the server infrastructure and the Clavio marketing automation layer in parallel. The speaker used the transcript and audio from the iPhone app to review critical information, noting the difference in presentation between the phone and web browser interfaces (01:30:24) (01:40:52). The importance of the current foundational work was stressed, as it is the most difficult part, after which the rest of the system builds easily (01:42:49).
Optimizing Live HANA Ingestion Agent Settings: While reviewing the Live HANA ingestion agent configuration, Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary observed that the reasoning effort was set to "low," the verbosity was set to "medium," and the summary was set to "auto" (01:44:29). It was advised that these settings were not optimal for a tier one enterprise application. The correct configurations were provided: Reasoning Effort should be High because the ingestion agent handles complex data validation and error handling, which low reasoning severely limits. Verbosity should be Low for concise logs and status reports, as medium creates unnecessary noise (01:45:46). Summary should be Null because auto-summary for an ingestion agent is illogical, and null is the correct choice over "detailed" or "auto" (01:47:01).
Optimal Tier One Agent Settings and Model Choice: Optimal settings for the Live HANA ingestion agent were advised as (01:47:01): Display response in chat: Yes (needed for monitoring/debugging). Show search sources: Yes (critical for audit trails and data lineage). Continue on error: Off (ingestion agents must halt on errors to prevent processing corrupted data). Write to conversation history: On (essential for debugging and regulatory compliance). These settings prioritize operational reliability, transparency, and control. For the model choice, the available options were Chat GPT5 and Chat GPT5 Pro 2025106 (01:48:24). The Chat GPT5 Pro 2025106 version, with the specific date stamp, was confirmed as the superior choice, representing the most advanced reasoning model (01:49:33).
Tier One Tool Configuration for Live HANA Ingestion Agent: The required tools for the Live HANA ingestion agent were identified (01:49:33): MCP Server (essential for data source connections), File Search (critical for accessing COA documents and policy files), Web Search (needed for policy monitoring and regulatory updates), and Code Interpreter (useful for data transformation and validation scripts). Tools to skip were Chatkit client tool, Local function, and Custom. The MCP Server tool was highlighted as the critical connection point for the Cloud Run endpoint (01:51:22).
Autonomous Agent Setup Sequence and Secrets Manager Priority: The emphasis must be on maximum autonomous agent completion with minimal human-in-the-loop work. The Tier One autonomous agent setup sequence was defined in two phases (01:52:39): Phase One: Secrets Manager Configuration—Configuring agent builder to access the cloud password vault and loading all API credentials. Phase Two: Agent Self-Configuration via Prompting—Once secrets are configured, the agent builder can be prompted to autonomously deploy the MCP server to Google Cloud Run, configure all tool connections, test data source connections, validate the pipeline, and generate the Cloud Run endpoint URL. The agent can only execute these configurations autonomously if it has proper API access through the secrets manager (01:54:11). The sequence is defined as "secrets, autonomous configuration, production deployment" (01:55:22).
The Vision for Live Hana Development and Comparison to Replet: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary shared their plan to rebuild Live Hana completely in both agent builder and Replet. The goal of rebuilding in Replet, despite having a superior cloud, is to compare the two models and test which Live Hana version is better (01:56:23). This comparison will help identify any superior features in the Replet setup that could be used to upgrade the internal model. The recurring theme established is that at the current level, the user only needs to provide the billing, passwords, and permissions, essentially the "credit card, the credential and the consent" (01:57:12).
Managing Complexity and Efficiency in Agent-Based System Development: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed the tendency for development work to become a "rat race" if they simply focus on being busy, emphasizing that they don't have to follow that path. The process involves the human (Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary) interacting with machines, such as launching an agent inside a web browser that goes into the agent builder (01:58:11). The objective is to account for all complexity and establish a full funnel vision, with the ingestion agent serving as the top of the funnel to capture and ingest all plans and data, refine and fuse it, find the optimal management area, and chunk it into granular tasks (01:59:04). They prioritize whether a machine can perform the task, and if so, the machine handles it, removing it from human workload. This involves determining the appropriate number of agents for proper context injection and token use, following the rule of "as much as necessary and as little as possible". This threading is applied across 69 domains and multiplying business layers (01:59:55).
Focus on Secret Management and Vault Setup: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary identified the secrets as the "most critical piece" that requires a start-and-finish focus (01:59:55). They noted previous instances of "secret leaks," which led them to prioritize setting up the vault. They spent time setting up the vault, a tool suggested by a Reals guy during a call, referencing one password. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary mentioned being suspicious that some secret leaks might have occurred and they may need to replace a key, although the setup is already in one password (02:00:54). The next step is to turn on the assistant, which includes Liv Hana and Claude, who is described as significantly smarter to talk to than Chat GPT (02:01:48).
Challenges with AI Assistants and Setting up Secret Manager: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary described the use of AI assistants, like Claude, as valuable but emphasized the need for constant attention to catch missteps, contradicting the idea that AI promotes laziness, and suggesting it acts as a "non-stop bullshit detector sensitizer". They stated that Chat GPT is "almost all bullshit" and requires extensive work to make its voice mode worthwhile (02:01:48). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary planned to set up the secret manager by sharing their screen again with Andrew Aparicio. They asked the AI assistant Claude for step-by-step instructions on setting up the Agent Builder secret manager to integrate with their one password vault, mentioning they were looking at the `platform.openai.com` agent builder editor and seeing the "live hana ingestion agent" and the "live hana perfector swarm max mcp agent" (02:03:06). The AI assistant provided generic instructions on accessing settings, finding the secrets/environment variables section, and looking for integrations, but acknowledged that the exact location varies (02:04:14). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary concluded that the AI assistant was providing generic guidance and did not know what it was talking about, leading them to stop the voice mode and switch to Chat GPT (02:05:21).
Troubleshooting and Technical Setup for Secret Management: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary encountered an issue where the preferred model was unavailable to their organization, forcing them to use the default model. They noted that Claude was "clueless" and had sent them on a "goose chase" looking for something that likely wasn't there (02:06:38). Andrew Aparicio suggested that at least the current system was researching instead of making up generic information (02:07:42). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary was attempting to set up the agent builder secret manager to integrate with their one password vault and referenced the steps from a text output, including creating a dedicated vault, a read-only service account, and exporting the service account token as an environmental variable (02:13:22) (02:18:05). They were trying to set up the vault once and for all so the agent would have all the keys and never need to ask again, possibly needing consent to use the key but always having access (02:11:23).
Current Status of Vault Setup and Agent Configuration: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary was focused on getting the one password service account token integrated, which they identified as the "key to the kingdom" (02:45:07). They reviewed their past attempts to create service accounts, noting they had three different ones previously (02:20:13). They confirmed that the vault setup allows them to get 500 MCP servers from this one setup. They emphasized the need to scope every agent with only the necessary MCP tool use for security and to prevent them from going rogue, creating partitioned permissions (02:12:28). The goal is to build "military grade" and "nation state level" tech where they own and control their "own black box" (02:13:22). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary found that the models keep sending them on a "goose chase" looking for a connector that does not exist (02:45:07). They learned from the AI output that they may need to create a secret in Agent Builder's secrets dashboard and use the token as the value, and then expose it as an environmental variable (02:46:02). They noted that they have the entire setup working in the Cursor environment with one password, but the integration process varies across different tools like Claude, which requires babysitting and fingerprinting every time it needs vault access, versus Codeex or Cheetah, which just run after a single access grant (02:48:59).
Discussion of Business and Personal Matters: Andrew Aparicio and Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed Christopher, who had been "down the last couple previous couple days," and their efforts to support him, including providing him with cannabis (02:09:07). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary mentioned a goal to solve issues for Christopher by getting an email off in the morning (02:09:53). They discussed the process of getting the agent into the cloud, which would then allow them to automate tasks like setting up Clavio and moving light speed data into the dashboard. They noted that they had not accessed the cloud for almost a week (02:10:37). Separately, Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary provided an update on their mother, who went to the hospital the previous night, after a critical doctor's test result required her to be taken to a "good hospital" by Savannah (02:26:50). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary also mentioned that they had pinched the top of a cola of cannabis for Christopher and usually smoke from the bottom up (02:09:07).
Addressing Financial and Property Issues with Lena (Accounting Department): Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary spoke with Lena, who was part of the accounting department, and informed Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary that a remaining balance of $14,000 was identified from a June payment. Lena suggested catching up by paying the regular rent plus an additional $2,000 per month (02:51:02). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained their current financial "pickle," detailing that online sales had been shut down for five months (since May) because Visa stopped Square from processing hemp sales online (02:52:17). They have a new payment processor set up as of last week, but cash flow is delayed, making it difficult to make payments immediately (02:53:18). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary offered to make half of the payment on Monday and the other half on Friday, adding they might be able to do better. Lena confirmed they would not charge fees, having already paid them (02:54:12). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary also brought up maintenance issues, stating there had been no AC since June, which Lena was unaware of, and referencing text messages with pictures of ceiling collapse and water damage. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary reported that AC still does not work, the roof damage remains, and the sink doesn't drain, and that workers had failed to show up or perform repairs despite three scheduled appointments (02:54:58).
Development Philosophy and Learning from AI Agents: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary acknowledged that a "full-blown engineer, coder" might find more efficient ways to perform the work with less error and harness the AI more intelligently than their "vibe coding" method. However, they asserted that their lack of expert coder status is not hindering progress. They described their method as "somewhat of a lazy way," yet they are utilizing all available bandwidth to learn how to be an engineer and understand the process "end to end," from idea, planning, and architecture to coding and product development (02:28:28). They view watching the agent work as an "accelerated learning method" tied to their own work (02:29:36). They detailed the process of agent development, mentioning they have had an agent run for three and a half hours while awake to verify, and potentially longer (five to six hours) at night, though it might get stuck in loops (02:38:23). The overall plan involves spinning up many agents for different jobs, such as 50-state compliance, the Texas Truth and Safety Act, the American Cannabis Freedom Act, and managing websites and domains, until the whole system is "ready for inspection" (02:40:22).
Evolution of AI Implementation and Business Opportunities: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary recalled that attempts to implement the voice mode with the full reasoning model failed, leading to a major realization that broadened the project's scope. The process of addressing the real problems of implementing AI developed solutions that could scale into new business opportunities, creating a scenario where there are "a whole bunch of businesses" they can roll out (02:41:48). An example was an initial problem with obtaining Anthropic's key, which was estimated to cost $20k to $50k to solve; Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary then decided to make $50k in 48 hours by exposing the problem, which led to the development of the "AI crisis consulting model" (02:43:05). They expressed belief that this process is helping to "reprogram my own brain" by redirecting negative energy towards the machines and maintaining discipline (02:50:01).
Payment Agreement and Housing Situation: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary stated that a payment plan was agreed upon, consisting of a wire transfer for half of the $5,500 ($2,750) on Monday and the remaining half on Friday. Andrew Aparicio noted that this "beats eviction 2017," and Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary agreed it buys them time to consider getting a different place, mentioning that they are considering better value options and will shop around, even if the current issues are fixed (02:58:09). Andrew Aparicio set a reminder for the Monday and Friday payments of $2,750. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary mentioned the payment details are in the meeting notes, which will be ingested by the "ingestion engine" in the "RPM machine" (02:59:06).
Agent Builder Service Account Secret Issue and Workflow: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary reported that the process for creating an OP service account secret inside Agent Builder and writing it up was failing, noting that the instructions mention clicking the "hamburger" icon in the top right toolbar of Agent Builder (02:59:06). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary expressed difficulty navigating and getting lost by flipping through all the tabs. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary noted that the process currently dictates that web search cannot be turned on simultaneously with "Asia mode". Andrew Aparicio commented on the significant amount of context loaded in these systems, which Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary confirmed is due to extensive work on the organization and efficiency of the context, including breaking down files into 500 lines or less for better RPM efficiency (03:00:10).
Competitive Advantage and AI Strategy: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed their advantage over a competitor, Agent Force, due to being "quick and nimble" while Agent Force is B2B and experiencing user adoption resistance. Their strategy involves the "light speeded website" reggiendro.com and utilizing AI to resolve issues, achieve user adoption, and seamlessly integrate AI. The goal is to give users access to "live HANA" in more ways, envisioning a future where users talk to the AI on the phone, and it references having solved specific problems like AD verification or handling a refund (03:02:52). Andrew Aparicio affirmed that the proof of concept is working, citing that it successfully logged in and added descriptions, ingredients, and COA notes to an item listing, making the primary task scaling and optimizing the solution (03:03:53).
AI Model Selection and Fiduciary Lens: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary observed that the AI sometimes flips the language to Spanish when instructed to use English, which Andrew Aparicio compared to the AI being "autistic". Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary contrasted Claude, which has a better sense of humor, with Chad GPT, which is more "anal" and suitable for specific tasks (03:03:53). They concluded that they are not locked into any single model and can utilize "all the above," including Gemini and other models, by plugging in any model. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary introduced the "fiduciary lens," which focuses on cost efficiency and determining if a task can be completed to the same standard for a lower cost with a different model. This strategy aims to save money on compute and resource usage when a less demanding model can perform the task, enabling the system to "withstand scale" (03:04:57).
Troubleshooting Agent Builder Secrets and Admin Keys: Andrew Aparicio inquired about "admin keys" when Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary was searching for secrets (03:04:57). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary found "Admin key" and "API key" options under Security but noted that the word "secrets" was not explicitly listed. Andrew Aparicio confirmed that admin keys are for programmatic administration of the account (03:06:09). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary later noted that the system was stumped on finding the secret, despite being told there is a secret manager (03:10:20). The system displayed an error message stating, "It appears the agent builder interface may not be fully accessible right now. I'm seeing page not found," which led Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary to hand the control back to the AI after logging in (03:11:26).
AC and Property Issues: Andrew Aparicio relayed a text message from Lena reporting that the AC is not working and is blowing no cool air. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary confirmed they are running their supplemental AC units but the main units are not working; otherwise, the temperature would be 85 degrees instead of the current 76. Andrew Aparicio confirmed that both upstairs and downstairs AC units are not working (03:06:09). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary mentioned they informed Lena about the refrigerator issue back in January. Andrew Aparicio inquired about yard work, which Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary suggested needed clarification, stating if they are not going to do it, they would do it if given permission, noting the property currently "Looks like homeless place" according to Andrew Aparicio. Other issues mentioned included the ceiling, the sink, the flooring, the fence, and the garage (03:08:10). Andrew Aparicio advised easing into addressing the issues with Lena since "she's letting us work through it, too," prioritizing the AC, ceiling, sink, and fridge (03:10:20).
AI Task Execution and Looping Problem: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary described watching the AI attempt to work, characterizing it as "slow motion" and encountering the same problem they had regarding how to delete something (03:11:26). The AI solved the issue by finding a trash can icon and slowly moving the cursor to click it, as opposed to using the keyboard delete key or right-click delete, which were unavailable (03:15:36). The AI then started going through steps that were not the main goal of setting the secret, prompting Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary to tell it to "slow your roll". The access to the secrets was described as "super secret". Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary decided to start a new chat, full of fresh tokens from the "live haunted project," so it can access everything needed (03:16:22). However, the AI attempted to find the secret manager again and found the same thing as before—no secrets listed, leading to a looping problem (03:18:10). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary ended the session with Andrew Aparicio and switched to using Claude, which provided a different solution involving the terminal (03:19:25).
Suggested next steps
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will design a training plan for Andrew Aparicio focused on his role and the specific parts of the cockpit and dashboards he needs to interact with, as well as providing him with a cockpit he can log into with dashboards.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will include a plan for Andrew Apparicio as director of operations to have his own login to a cockpit that has everything he needs in an interface, including live Hana in voice mode with reasoning and the ability to get access and view anything that he would need to do what he needs to do.
Andrew Aparicio will set up an abandoned cart email sequence with a 72-hour countdown automation and configure SMS capabilities for text messaging.
Andrew Aparicio will create a Clavio account using Reggie and Dro business details, set up a Google account, and import customer data from Square, focusing on the top 20% VIP OG members first.
Andrew Aparicio will design an immediate cash flow email targeting VIP customers and addressing current issues.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will pay half of the outstanding balance on Monday and the other half on Friday.
Andrew Aparicio will create a link for Hempress 3 seeds for the guy who wants to buy them.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will make a list of damaged items in the house and send it to Lena.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will continue to work on integrating the vault.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will get a wire payment of $2750 on Monday and the same amount on Friday.
Andrew Aparicio will put a reminder for Monday and Friday for $2750.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will fix the garage.
Andrew Aparicio will respond to Lena regarding the AC units not working.

The following is a summary of the key details from the Meeting started 2025/10/10 19:10 CDT transcript, directly relevant to the Liv Hana initiative, AI/Digital Sovereignty, and system requirements.Liv Hana and AI Music Initiative
Project Goal (Live Hana): To create commercially owned music using AI, which can be leveraged as a powerful marketing and educational tool.
Personalized Marketing Strategy:
Generate personalized songs for the company's top 100 customers.
Songs will incorporate customer names and draw on review data.
The content will quote customers and discuss product details (strain, smell, taste).
This is intended to create highly shareable content, drive widespread views, and educate customers.
Volume and Creativity: The AI is expected to be able to "pump out 10-20 songs on 18 channels on Sunday," and can generate diverse music genres, including urban styles.
Quality & Guardrail: A "Gabby test" for new songs is required before launching them, implying a critical human review for quality and audience appeal.
AI, Digital Sovereignty, and Policy Narrative

The discussion outlines a strategic focus on building a proprietary, sovereign AI to manage the business's digital self.
Digital Sovereignty Mandate: The core focus is on building a "sovereign AI" for digital self-ownership, emphasizing the need to "own your ass before someone else does."
Policy/Guardrail Requirements (Stateful AI):
The company's AI must be stateful (i.e., remember prior interactions and data) and grant the user legal rights to the output.
This is contrasted with "stateless systems" like ChatGPT, where user data is not owned by the user.
The final goal is to own the database, the agent, and the keys "in perpetuity" (e.g., via blockchain) for complete digital sovereignty.
Voice Mode and Interface Refinements:
The long-term vision is a future where "interfaces are not needed" because AI agents (which are currently at a "PhD expert level or better") perform tasks seamlessly.
Staff should be able to simply "talk to them" and the agent will execute the task on-screen.
There is a clear need for a single, custom portal/cockpit that integrates the separate systems (Light Speed, delivery), possibly voice-driven, to eliminate the need for manual interface navigation.
VIP Team Roles and Dashboard/Interface Requirements

Based on the structure outlined in the meeting, team roles and their inferred interface needs for efficiency are:VIP Team MemberRole/ResponsibilityInterface & Data View RequirementsJesseTech and Business Vision, AI Strategy.Integrated Cockpit/Dashboard for all systems (POS, delivery, sales, and AI project status). Needs cognitive orchestration features to minimize manual interface use.Andrew AparicioSupply Chains and Logistics, System Summary.Product Performance View (e.g., strong sellers like "420 QP," chocolate/blue raspberry edibles), Inventory and Supply Chain Data, and Light Speed POS Data for process optimization (free grams, discount codes, systems flow).Reggie & Dro Cannabis DispensaryBrick-and-Mortar Store Operations, Leadership.Store Operations Summary, Staff Accountability Tools ("Crew Court" system), and POS System Scalability Metrics (viability for thousands of transactions and 3PL integration).ChristopherStore Manager (Implied Operational Lead).Streamlined POS Interface that merges e-commerce and retail views, efficient Order Status Management for pickup/delivery flags, and Cash Payment Processing for online sales.ReggieAndDro.com Customer Journey: Checkout and System Pain Points

The primary manual pain points in the current customer journey revolve around event ticket processing and POS integration.
Puff and Paint Ticket Journey (Pre-automation):
Customer buys a ticket online.
Order is received in the separate e-commerce app.
Staff must manually hold the order and only move it to "delivered" on the day of the event to generate a barcode/receipt.
The ticket is then manually validated on arrival by the staff member.
Proposed Automation (Action Item):
Customer clicks buy.
System must auto-process the order immediately (removing the human element).
A second email is automatically sent to the customer containing a scannable QR code or barcode.
Barcode is scanned on arrival, and the system automatically marks the ticket as used and invalid for re-use.
POS Interface/Cash Payment Pain Point:
The Light Speed system runs as two separate iPad applications (e-commerce and retail), which complicates transactions.
Processing a single cash payment for an online order requires staff to navigate between the two separate apps and log into each one, which is described as creating a "digital drawer" for a single sale.
(Note: The process of Veriff age verification was not explicitly detailed in the transcript, though strict regulatory compliance and ID checks for customers were emphasized.)

Oct 10, 2025Meeting Oct 10, 2025 at 19:10 CDTMeeting records Transcript Recording 
SummaryReggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary, along with Andrew Aparicio, Jesse, Gabby, Gina, Dylan, and Christopher, discussed the company's direction, including documenting milestones, fostering a positive team environment, and outlining roles where Jesse handles tech and business vision, Andrew Aparicio manages supply chains, and Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary oversees the brick-and-mortar store. Key discussion points included implementing the Light Speed system, improving the Puff and Paint ticket process, exploring AI music and digital sovereignty, establishing a local delivery system, and introducing a "crew court" for accountability. They also recognized Andrew Aparicio as September employee of the month and Gabby for store decorations, while addressing challenges with the POS system, discussing cannabis product performance, and strategizing on music as a marketing tool for future growth and regulatory compliance.DetailsNotes Length: Standard
Meeting Logistics and Atmosphere Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary initiated the meeting, noting Gabby's anticipated lateness and Darren's absence, but confirmed they were good to proceed (00:00:00). They emphasized creating a positive, good-vibes-only environment for all meetings, regardless of store performance, to foster team improvement rather than criticism (00:09:12). The meeting commenced with a ceremonial smoking session intended to set a calm mood, free of emotions or ego, and participants were encouraged to smoke throughout the meeting while remaining attentive (00:12:46).
Documentation of Company Milestones Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary highlighted the importance of documenting significant company events, such as this initial team meeting, akin to how major tech companies preserve artifacts from their origins (00:03:51). They planned to date and sign a document marking this first team meeting, ensuring a tangible record of the team's commitment to building their desired company, whether it succeeds or fails (00:05:52).
Leadership and Team Dynamics Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary defined their role as the "current selected leader amongst equals," stressing the importance of fair and equitable treatment among all team members (00:10:11). They acknowledged the challenges of growth and past mistakes, taking personal responsibility for any bumps and issues, particularly regarding historical sales figures, while focusing on future improvements (00:17:10). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary also expressed happiness for the team's ability to work together through life's dramas (00:18:13).
Meeting Agenda Overview Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary outlined the meeting's agenda: opening comments and the smoke ceremony, followed by recognitions, a 15-minute store summary, a systems summary by Andrew Aparicio, and a 45-minute presentation by Jesse on their vision for the store (00:19:15). They also clarified the operational structure, with Jesse handling tech and business vision, Andrew Aparicio managing supply chains and logistics, and Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary overseeing the brick-and-mortar store.
Employee Recognition Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary announced Andrew Aparicio as the September employee of the month, a recognition that includes an ounce of a chosen cannabis strain as a thank you from Jesse and themself (00:20:06). They also spotlighted Gabby for their hard work in decorating the store, making it "spooktacular," and thanked Gina, Dylan, Gabby, and Andrew Aparicio for their contributions in enabling Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary to step back from constant direct management of the store (00:21:02).
Store Operations Summary Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary provided a summary of store operations, noting the shift to a new seven-shift, 70-hour weekly schedule to better manage budget and resources. Dylan was identified as the only full-time employee, covering Mondays through Thursdays, and the store will operate daily from 10 AM to 7 PM, with Friday, Saturday, and Sunday shifts remaining open (00:21:59). The schedule will be released a month in advance for predictability, and tier 2 crew members will be prioritized for shifts (00:22:44).
Local Government Compliance and Store Vibe Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed the store's adaptation to local government enforcement, noting improved customer compliance with ID checks due to the staff's consistent hard work (00:23:23). They encouraged employees to act as brand ambassadors, setting a positive vibe for the store and treating it as their own to drive sales (00:24:07). They also offered support for staff making judgment calls regarding system shortcuts, asking only for documentation of free grams given away to help Andrew Aparicio optimize processes (00:24:44).
Light Speed System Implementation Feedback Andrew Aparicio thanked the team, including Gina, Dylan, Gabby, and Christopher, for their help in implementing the new Light Speed system. He offered ongoing support and specific training as needed, indicating that he would share discount codes for Puff and Paint, review grams, and staff online purchases via group chat to streamline operations (00:26:24). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary expressed relief at moving off the old Square system, noting it had hindered online sales for five months (00:28:20).
Light Speed System Challenges The team discussed difficulties with the Light Speed system, particularly its user interface and the need for staff to navigate between two separate iPad apps—one for e-commerce and one for retail—which contrasts with Square's integrated single system (00:29:23). This dual-app setup complicates processing sales, especially when customers pay cash for online orders, requiring staff to log into separate applications for different stages of a single transaction and refresh screens to track sales (00:31:21) (00:34:28). The issue is further exacerbated by the system's tendency to log off terminals and require payment system resets (00:35:11).
Improving Puff and Paint Ticket System The team identified a key issue with tracking Puff and Paint attendees: tickets purchased online are not automatically marked as used when attendees arrive, requiring manual updates by staff (00:39:05). They proposed implementing a QR code or barcode scanning system, similar to arena tickets, that would automatically invalidate a digital ticket after its first use, thereby streamlining the process and reducing manual errors (00:40:26). Currently, barcodes are only generated upon marking an order as "delivered," which requires a manual step and can be easily missed (00:41:55).
Proposed System Automation for Tickets To address the manual processing of tickets, Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary suggested automating the system so that when a customer buys a Puff and Paint ticket online, it is immediately auto-processed, generating a barcode on the receipt and sending it to the customer via a second email. This change would remove the human element from the early processing stage, ensuring the barcode is available for scanning upon arrival at the event and preventing early or mistaken processing by staff (00:43:36).
AI Music Project: Live Hana Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary introduced the concept of Live Hana, an AI music project capable of creating commercially owned music (00:46:24). They explained that this AI could generate personalized songs for the company's top 100 customers by incorporating their names and drawing on review data, which they anticipate will lead to widespread sharing and increased views. Despite some initial "rough drafts," the team sees significant potential in using AI to produce a high volume of unique songs (00:49:25).
AI Music Implementation and Creativity The discussion about AI music included the idea of generating diverse music genres, including urban styles, and the potential for a song about their hometown to become popular (00:54:41). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary mentioned personal experiences with AI-generated music, including their grandson's enjoyment of songs created by Charlie (00:53:10). They encouraged employees to feel free to play various music genres in the store, supporting individual expression in setting the store's vibe (00:57:17).
AI and Digital Sovereignty Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary emphasized the rapid advancement of AI to "PhD expert level" and their focus on building a sovereign AI for digital self-ownership (01:08:16). They explained that owning one's AI, with stateful data and legal rights, is crucial for digital sovereignty, comparing it to having personal control over one's data unlike stateless systems such as ChatGPT (01:11:11). The goal is to move towards a future where interfaces are not needed, and AI agents can perform tasks seamlessly for the user, with the user owning the data and keys (01:14:41).
Local Delivery Implementation Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary is developing a local delivery system for their business, noting that Square and other platforms do not offer a native "local delivery" button. They plan to integrate middleware from Nash, which contracts with white-label delivery companies like Uber, DoorDash, and HV company favor, to offer free delivery and ensure the best pricing by allowing bids from multiple delivery services (01:16:06). This initiative aims to establish a full-court press on local delivery across Texas (01:17:21).
Accountability through "Crew Court" Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary introduced a "crew court" system to foster accountability without punishment, distinct from traditional job environments. In this court, an employee or manager can be called to address issues, with Jesse acting as the judge and uninvolved crew members serving as witnesses and jury (01:21:26). The system's ultimate goal is to generate understanding and allow individuals to voice how actions affected them, promoting mutual comprehension (01:24:23).
Managerial Challenges and Family Issues Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary shared personal challenges including non-stop stress for the past two years, with significant family issues involving their mother's health and their younger brother's imprisonment in Manila (01:28:30) (01:34:53). They expressed difficulty in relaxing due to constant demands and the need to care for family members across different locations and challenging circumstances (01:28:30) (01:31:23). Despite these personal struggles, they remain committed to growing the company (01:27:39).
POS System and Scaling Operations Andrew Aparicio highlighted the challenges with the current Point of Sale (POS) system, describing it as two synced but distinct systems that are manual and quirky. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary inquired if the current two-system setup could scale to handle thousands of daily transactions and shipments, expressing concerns about its viability for future growth and 3PL (third-party logistics) integration (01:38:23). Andrew Aparicio generally believes the system is not "that bad," but acknowledged the manual effort required (01:39:18).
Cannabis Product Performance Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio discussed the strong sales performance of certain cannabis products, specifically mentioning a "420 QP" and chocolate and blue raspberry edibles (01:41:34). Andrew Aparicio noted that the edibles sell well and have a good markup, indicating consistent customer demand for these items (01:42:38). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary also highlighted that customers frequently re-up on the "420 QP" every two weeks, signifying its popularity (01:41:34).
Music and Marketing Strategy Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary proposed using music as a marketing tool, suggesting the creation of custom songs for customers that quote them and discuss product details like strain, smell, and taste (01:19:45). They also mentioned a "Gabby test" for new songs, where Gabby's approval would be required before launching them, implying a focus on quality and audience appeal (01:44:29). This strategy aims to create shareable content and educate customers (01:19:45).
Regulatory Compliance and Future Vision Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary emphasized the importance of strict compliance to navigate the "drug war" and avoid legal issues, citing instances of law enforcement probing and sting operations (01:50:50). They aim for the company to become a model shop for regulation in San Antonio and Texas, partnering with DSHS to define fair regulatory practices (01:52:23). Their vision includes obtaining full panel COA (Certificate of Analysis) for all products to ensure quality and setting a new standard for the industry (01:53:52).
Company Growth and Expansion Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary articulated a vision for significant company growth beyond the current store, aiming for expansion across Texas and potentially even internationally, spurred by personal circumstances such as their brother's imprisonment in Manila (01:40:22). Andrew Aparicio confirmed that "Dragon" is already exploring opening two additional locations and seeking a loan to support this expansion (01:55:36). The plan also involves optimizing the website for a superior user experience, potentially leading to more online orders and reduced reliance on in-store retail transactions (01:56:38).
Online Sales and Cash Payments Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed the efficiency of using the website to fill customer carts for sales, noting it is faster than the back-end system. Andrew Aparicio clarified that the back end is only necessary for cash payments on online sales. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary confirmed that for all other payment types, the website can be used as if it were Square, directly filling the customer's cart (01:58:02).
Order Status and Delivery Flags Andrew Aparicio highlighted the need to flag orders as "delivered" in the back end for pickup orders. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary acknowledged that this requires navigating the back end to change the order status, estimating it would take only a couple of clicks to update (01:58:52). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that this manual movement of orders, such as to "processing" or "waiting payment/pickup," is necessary to notify customers when their orders are ready (01:59:40).
Personal Updates and Future Plans Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary shared personal updates, including a seven-and-a-half-week "dope detox" and plans to be in California frequently until May (02:00:19). They also discussed their mother's living situation, mentioning the intention to bring her to live closer to them to ensure their well-being and avoid hospital visits (02:01:20). They also mentioned plans to improve their house, including ripping out bubbled carpet, to accommodate visitors with wheelchairs (02:02:13).
Meeting Conclusion The meeting concluded with Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary thanking everyone for coming and marking the official end of the discussion, while inviting participants to stay and smoke if they wished (02:03:16). Andrew Aparicio also expressed their thanks, apologizing for not being able to attend in person, and Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary responded that they were present (02:03:55).
Suggested next steps
Andrew Aparicio will send discount codes for Puff and Paint, free G, and staff 420 in the group chat to streamline things.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will figure out how to merge the e-commerce and retail apps into one, ensuring the interface supports cash payments for online orders and separate logins for processing cash sales.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will ensure the system automatically processes orders and sends a second email with a scannable barcode for event tickets upon purchase.

This summary extracts the key details from the meeting transcript, focusing on the Liv Hana project, the compliance-driven policy narrative, VIP roles, and the new customer journey.I. Liv Hana & Voice-Driven Cognitive Orchestration

The Liv Hana (Live Hana) project is the core of the new operational system, focused on minimizing manual work through agent orchestration and a voice-driven interface.
Voice Mode as a Control Layer: Voice mode will integrate with Live Hana, allowing the user to "vibe code through Live Hana" to direct project management. Live Hana acts as a wrapper to control the underlying agents (Sonnet and Claude).
Agent Orchestration: Agents are being built to live and work in and around the websites for non-stop testing, bug fixing, and continuous improvement. They are orchestrated within the company's new organizational chart.
Agent Workflow: The system uses multiple AI tools, where Codeex is envisioned as a "better boss" and Claude as a "better worker" within the same environment, enhancing efficiency and reducing errors.
Strategic Focus: The goal is to transition from relying on automated workflows to utilizing autonomous agents for every major service, viewing AI as a "force multiplier" for doing "more with less."
Infrastructure Priority: Development prioritizes "function before fashion," focusing on backend infrastructure (like Replit, the "foundation, water, and power") before immediate aesthetic design.
II. Policy Narrative, Guardrails, and Compliance (DSHS/COA)

The response to the DSHS warning letter is being strategically integrated into the development of compliance tools and the overall policy narrative.
DSHS Response Priority: A response to the DSHS warning letter is critically due by Sunday (October 5th) and is driving the development of new compliance tools.
Compliance Tools: The plan is to build a free Texas COA checker tool with phone camera scan capability, explicitly designed to assist DSHS inspectors with their job and enhance enforcement efficiency.
"Web Empire" Strategy: A comprehensive web empire is being created to support compliance by hyperlinking resources such as Texas law, federal law, 50-state legal compliance, and Texas full panel COA templates.
Policy Narrative: The official response to DSHS will position Reggie & Dro as an ally to the agency, highlighting the compliance and educational tools created to assist DSHS with inspections.
Guardrail Requirement (COAs): The main compliance roadblock is the requirement for full panel Certificates of Analysis (COAs) for all products, a significant expense due to past lab issues and regulatory reinterpretation.

ReggieAndDro.com Customer Journey: The Win-Back Strategy

The customer journey is designed to maximize conversions and comply with regulations by moving all critical checks post-checkout and leveraging a 72-hour refund countdown as a compliance guardrail.
Pre-Checkout Disclosure: A pop-up is required to capture a simple legal disclosure (clicking 21+ constitutes agreement to age ID rules).
Purchase & Payment: Customer completes the order and payment.
Post-Checkout Automated Verification (Immediate): The system triggers a check on the order page for:
Age ID Verification
R&D membership agreement current opt-in subscriber status
LightSpeed loyalty program check/auto-enrollment
Order Fulfillment Guardrail: No order fulfillment is allowed without 100% age ID verification and current membership status.
Automated Follow-up Sequence:
If verification or membership is not confirmed, the customer is immediately notified of a 72-hour countdown to an automatic refund.
Automated follow-up sequences are sent with a clear call-to-action to complete the verification or membership status update to secure the order.

Voice Mode and Agent Integration Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed the voice mode's role in integrating with Live Hana, which controls two agents and a cursor, enabling direct voice interaction for comprehensive project management (00:00:00). They aim for the voice mode to allow them to "vibe code through Live Hana" to direct Sonnet and Claude in their tasks (00:06:33).
Cannabis Product Discussion Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio discussed various cannabis strains and products, including Wagu's, Strawberry Gary, Mule Fuel, and Permanent Marker. They also discussed the freshness of newly dried cannabis (00:01:49).
KCA Labs and COAs Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary mentioned having the credit card authorization for KCA Labs to set up an account and send samples for Certificates of Analysis (COAs). They plan to collaborate with Charlie to obtain fresh products for testing and COAs (00:02:40).
Online Sales and Shipping Strategy Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary emphasized the potential of online delivery, noting a customer base of over 11,300 people. They discussed the necessity of preparing for a high volume of shipments, potentially overwhelming the current shipping capabilities, and the need to scale operations with a 3PL (third-party logistics) provider (00:03:32) (00:18:10).
3PL and Automated Systems Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary highlighted the importance of using 3PL services for shipping and inventory management, aiming to temporarily handle shipping in-house before transitioning to a 3PL provider (00:04:41). They expressed a desire to automate major services and utilize agents for these tasks rather than relying solely on automated workflows (00:05:47).
LightSpeed POS Shipping Issue Andrew Aparicio identified a critical blocker in the LightSpeed POS system preventing the purchase and printing of shipping labels due to unconfigured billing details (00:12:15). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary offered to log in and resolve the issue, suggesting the integration of Pirate Ship for potentially lower shipping costs (00:13:06).
Local Delivery vs. Shipping Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary indicated that local delivery is a larger priority than shipping for increasing sales. Andrew Aparicio noted that Leafly is also interested in promoting local deliveries (00:11:28) (00:13:47).
Leafly Billing Dispute Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary expressed frustration with Leafly's billing practices, particularly regarding charges for unrequested ads, and asserted that they do not owe the disputed amount (00:14:43). Despite the billing issue, they aim to obtain the API key to fully utilize the Leafly profile, regardless of whether they spend money on Leafly ads (00:17:18).
Social Media and Website Overhaul Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary outlined plans for a comprehensive makeover of social media, the website, and email setups to announce online purchasing availability (00:18:10). They plan to start with smaller campaigns for VIP customers before a full blast to all subscribers (00:19:18).

Andrew Aparicio affirmed their capability to achieve an average of $3,000 in daily sales (00:21:02).
Weekly Planning and Information Sharing Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary planned to finalize a weekly plan over the weekend to prepare for Live Hana training starting Monday, and committed to sharing information through PDFs and markdown files (00:22:52). They also intended to ingest past meeting transcripts to inform their current actions (00:23:34).
COA and Checker Tool Development Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary initiated work on building a Texas COA (Certificate of Analysis) and a COA checker tool with phone camera scan capability (00:25:45) (00:32:34). This project is a priority for them and is intended to be completed efficiently (00:28:29).
Automated System Functionality and Costs Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary demonstrated their automated system, which manages files, coordinates with weekly plans, and renames files based on priority changes (00:09:09). They acknowledged the significant cost of running the system, noting they had maxed out their weekly Claude limit and were incurring direct billing, but viewed it as a valuable investment (00:43:24).
Customer Win-Back Strategy Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary outlined a customer win-back strategy involving automated post-checkout verification, membership agreement checks, and loyalty program enrollment (00:52:43). This strategy includes automated follow-up sequences and a 72-hour refund countdown if verification or membership is not confirmed (00:58:36).
Website and Agent Integration Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that they are building agents to operate within and around the website to ensure continuous testing, bug fixing, and improvements. These agents will be orchestrated within the company's organizational chart, creating an efficient and constantly evolving system (00:59:27).
Initial Online Order Success Christopher Rocha announced that Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary received their first online order for Graham, which was confirmed as a "real order" by Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary emphasized the importance of local delivery for conversions and sales (01:00:44).
Website Development and Issues Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary noted that the website is still in development and not yet customized, planning to avoid major announcements until it is "f\\\\\*g shiny". They also mentioned encountering bugs, such as vast amounts of scrolling and data, and issues with files and search functions, highlighting the site's current "rinky dink" state (01:01:52).
Replit and Codeex Workstreams Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed their use of Replit and Codeex for different aspects of development. They described Replit as a "massive" and "whole different agent framework" for backend infrastructure, while Codeex is considered the best tool for prototyping but lacks the capability for hardcore backend work (01:05:57). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary likened Codeex to building the "walls and roof and the windows" of a house, but not the "foundation, the water, and the sewer and the septic and the power" (01:10:06).
DSHS Warning Letter and COA Challenges Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Christopher Rocha discussed a DSHS warning letter requiring a response by October 5th. The main issue is the need for full panel Certificates of Analysis (COAs) for all products, a significant expense due to past lab issues and reinterpretation of regulations (01:11:12). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary noted that the cost per passing strain is approximately $400-600, with about half of the strains failing, effectively doubling the cost (01:12:55).
Addressing Compliance Issues and Strategic Response Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary confirmed that previous issues with smokable hemp products and missing credit lab testing were resolved, but a new argument regarding Tastonic's URL link on labels presented a challenge (01:14:50). They planned to respond to the DSHS letter by emphasizing their status as an ally to the organization and highlighting the compliance and educational tools they have created, such as the free COA checker tool, which aims to help DSHS with inspections. Christopher Rocha suggested that a proper response might lead DSHS to "leave [Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary] alone" (01:27:30) (01:35:22).
Development of a Web Empire for Compliance Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary detailed plans to build a comprehensive web empire to support compliance, including hyperlinking various resources like Texas law, federal law, 50-state legal compliance, Texas full panel COA templates, and the free Texas checker tool (01:38:49). They emphasized that these tools are designed to assist DSHS with their job and enhance inspection efficiency (01:36:00) (01:39:30). The platform will be mobile-optimized and robustly secured, with Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary having invested significant time in debugging security through "red teaming" with 2,000 agents (01:40:22).
AI Tool Integration and Workflow Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed their reliance on various AI tools like Codeex, Deep Seek, and Liv Hana, noting that each tool has specific strengths but none are fully comprehensive on their own (01:52:54). They explained their workflow involves synthesizing information from multiple AI outputs, ruthlessly editing out "garbage," and harnessing the competition between models to achieve better results and minimize "hallucinating" or false outputs (01:56:47).
AI and Workflow Optimization Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed their process of utilizing AI models like DeepSeek and Chat GPT5 for project development, specifically mentioning their use for processing Texas COA checker files (01:58:39). They explained how Codex acts as a "better boss" and Claude as a "better worker" within the same environment, with Codex ensuring Claude's work is not sloppy (02:00:19). This collaborative AI approach aims to improve efficiency and reduce errors by having the models learn from each other through constant monitoring and feedback (02:10:59).
Overcoming Development Challenges Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary revealed they recently gained traction in cutting out "s***" from their process, indicating a breakthrough in their development (01:58:39). They encountered a "profanity filter" issue that seemingly hindered their AI's performance, which they found "ridiculous" given their legal cannabis business context (02:02:37). Despite this, they remain focused on the "infrastructure" of their system rather than immediate aesthetic design, emphasizing "function before fashion" for their websites (02:09:57) (02:13:10).
Project Progress and Data Integration Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary reported successfully importing Texas COA assets and creating backend and frontend deployments (02:01:28). They expressed pride in their ability to integrate Square data into their cloud database using Google Cloud, BigQuery, and Alloy Database, which was a complex task. They plan to have a string of functional websites ready for the team by Monday and are confident about live HANA training on the same day (02:15:22).
Future Plans and AI Philosophy Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary aims to have a "gang of robots" working on their websites and business, serving their needs (02:17:18). They believe AI can help humans distinguish truth from falsehood, promoting more critical thinking rather than laziness. Christopher Rocha concurred, viewing AI as a "force multiplier" that enables doing "more with less" (02:18:30).

Automated Website Updates and Verification Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary demonstrated how the system automatically performs tasks like removing "weed verbiage" from the site and adding product ingredients to listings (01:12:31) (01:35:31). They emphasized the goal of real-time verification of these changes online, planning to review 69 domain names daily for feedback (01:19:37) (01:20:54). Andrew Aparicio confirmed seeing the machine add comments to listings (01:35:31).
Website Language and Conversion Strategy Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed converting website language for bank compliance and sales, proposing "value," "premium," and "ultra ultra premium" tiers for products instead of "low, mid, top shelf" (01:37:14). They also suggested replacing "cannabis dispensary" with "premium THCA private social club" and using A/B split testing to optimize conversion language (01:38:34).
Brother's Legal Situation and Support Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary shared their brother's imprisonment in Manila due to alleged bribery by an ex-business partner (01:23:20) (01:29:45). They are launching a GoFundMe and Facebook page for their brother, "freejasonniss.com," and plan to involve their brother as an "area of management zero" within their business model, seeing this as a potential mutual benefit (01:25:18) (01:29:45).
Financial Situation and Cash Flow Needs Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary mentioned being in a financial pinch, needing serious cash flow for their brother's situation and owing money to Andrew Aparicio and others (01:25:18).

They emphasized the program's potential to boost traffic to Reggie Andro by leveraging AI across various sectors (01:51:48).
Cheetah AI Development and Error Resolution Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed the ongoing development of Cheetah AI, acknowledging that it is fast and closer to perfect than other systems but still experiences errors. They demonstrated the process of copying and pasting commands to resolve issues, such as age verification gate failures caused by missing files or permission issues (01:50:39) (01:52:45). They noted that failures are part of the process and the focus is on how to deal with them to win (01:54:29).
AI Competitive Analysis and Strategy Refinement Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary highlighted Live HANA's competitive advantage in the AI market, asserting that it is two to three years ahead of competitors and operates at a higher tier of AI transformation (01:58:53). They described using Cheetah's fallacy scan to identify and fix critical flaws in their strategy, such as overgeneralization and confirmation bias, to ensure measurable improvements (02:00:16). They are using Sonnet 4.5 and Chat GPT5 for continuous improvement and to remove vulnerabilities (01:57:34) (02:01:33).
Red Teaming and AI Competition Andrew Aparicio and Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed the concept of "red teaming," defining it as simulating attacks on one's own system to identify vulnerabilities, similar to hacking. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that they pit different frontier AI models like Cheetah (Gemini), Sonnet 4.5, and Chat GPT5 against each other to red team, ensuring comprehensive scrutiny of the system. They noted that this process helps identify holes that individual models might miss (02:10:47) (02:12:36).
AI Application to Personal Finance and Consumerism Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary proposed that Live HANA could function as a purchasing agent for individuals, securing their data and solving financial problems automatically, similar to automated trading systems for consumers. They envisioned the system helping users find cannabis at the best prices with documented compliance, eventually extending its utility to managing subscriptions, grocery shopping, and personal budgets (02:05:42). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary shared a vision of the system helping people become more valuable and fund trading accounts, aiming for a "billion dollar unicorn" strategy (02:06:59).
Marine Corps Training Philosophy and AI Application Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed the effectiveness of Marine Corps training, emphasizing its focus on discipline, values like honor, courage, and commitment, and leadership at every level (02:16:25) (02:19:37). They expressed how this structured and rigorous approach, which includes human psychology, is being applied to train machines, as machines do not have feelings and respond well to such methods (02:18:51). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary noted that the process of "reprogramming" themselves through Marine Corps training aligns with their efforts to refine the AI's performance (02:19:37).
Family Challenges and Personal Growth Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary opened up about personal family struggles, including concerns about their son's potential brain injury and its impact on their relationship (02:36:08) (02:42:18). They shared the emotional difficulty of dealing with their son's anger and blaming behavior, expressing a desire to improve their relationship (02:37:37). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary also mentioned broader family issues involving irrational behavior and trust, acknowledging that Andrew Aparicio has helped them identify behaviors and embrace truth-testing for personal improvement (02:43:09).
Current System Status and Meeting Logistics Andrew Aparicio confirmed that the age gate link is live but non-functional upon clicking buttons, indicating an error (02:22:34). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary requested that Andrew Aparicio list tasks and concerns for the RPM weekly plan, including car issues and airplane tickets, and confirmed an in-person team meeting at the shop on Friday, October 10th, from 7:30 to 9:30 PM (02:29:12). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary suggested providing food for the team meeting and offering free legal cannabis (02:29:56).
AI Development Progress and Future Goals Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary continued to push for full automation of deployments and demanded live hyperlinks as proof of work from Cheetah AI (02:30:39). Andrew Aparicio acknowledged the significant progress made in AI development, noting the increased speed of output and the need for the final pieces to connect for full machine-like functionality (02:35:16). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary stated their goal of showing higher-level dot connections and preparing the system for production (02:36:08).
Cloud Shell and Playwright Testing Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that they are now running code directly in the cloud shell without needing to go through the terminal, which resolved issues with shared session access (02:46:27). They emphasized the importance of high focus due to nuances in the code, referencing a past project where a single space in the code caused significant delays (02:48:21). They also noted that current tools, despite their sensitivity, allow for simultaneous coding and other activities when set up correctly (02:49:24).
Live Hana Voice Mode and AI Development Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary demonstrated the voice mode of Live Hana, noting that the web browser version did not initially have voice mode, unlike ChatGPT (02:50:52). They worked to enable the team to hear and interact with Live Hana, adjusting audio settings to ensure clarity (02:51:54). Andrew Aparicio and Christopher Roachcha engaged with Live Hana, asking questions about store improvements and Live Hana's activities when not in use (02:53:22).
AI State and Continuous Learning Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary highlighted the difference between Live Hana, which is always on and continuously learning, and ChatGPT4 in voice mode, which they described as "stateless" (02:54:14). They instructed Live Hana to study project knowledge and repository data to gain full context and truthfulness, aiming for a more advanced, "stateful" AI for future iterations (02:55:06). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary expressed a desire for Live Hana to be consistently available and interactive throughout future sessions, eliminating reliance on individual mental states (02:56:52).

Live Hana (SI) Project: Deep-Dive Summary and Integration Points

The meeting transcript details the strategic and technical integration of Synthetic Intelligence (SI), referred to as Live Hana, into the core business and operations of Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary. The goal is to move "beyond AI" and establish a "source of truth" system that automates processes, ensures data sovereignty, and maximizes value creation.1. SI Core Philosophy and Guardrails
Beyond AI to SI (Synthetic Intelligence): The company is operating on a "frontier model" called SI, leveraging agent synergy to achieve a "thousandx" increase in speed and progress (00:18:13, 00:19:08).
Policy Narrative: Fiduciary Responsibility: Live Hana is designed with a programmed fiduciary responsibility to the user. It is intended to optimize, protect, and maximize the user's "potency, consistency, [and] probability" in every area of management, protecting their assets and liabilities (00:28:04).
Agent Management and Accountability: The core "Trinity" team (Claude for strategy, Cheetah for coding, and Replet for scaling) operates based on "guaranteed commitment contracts," not just memory. Agents are held to these contracts daily, and failure results in elimination from the "unicorn race." The system's purpose is to get the "first answer correct 100% the first time" (00:05:58, 00:20:48, 00:26:45).
Data Sovereignty: A key differentiator for Live Hana is that the individual user or entity "keep[s] your data and your data sovereign," unlike with external platforms like Google or Amazon (00:35:57).
2. Voice Mode and Cognitive Orchestration
Minimizing Manual Interface: The primary goal for human interaction is to evolve past manual interface clicks. Day-to-day operations should be conducted through talking or video (00:33:05).
Real-Time Context and Vision: Video mode allows Live Hana to "see" the environment, enabling real-time feedback and vision-based orchestration, as opposed to solely text-based input (00:34:00).
Conversational Approval: Automated system suggestions—such as finding a subscription that can be cancelled—will move from a manual "click here" to a simple conversational approval: "I can go to switch it over. It's going to save you a hundred bucks a month. Just say the word and I'll do it" (00:31:19).
3. RPM Weekly Plan and Action ItemsRPM Weekly Plan FocusKey Insights and ActionsDomain & DNS ManagementAction Item: Reggie & Dro will iterate the successful DNS and hosting process for the top five key domains and then "parallel out agents" to apply the same process to the remaining 69 domains (01:55:43).Inventory & Supply ChainInsight: Current inventory intake and labeling is manual (02:01:08). Action Item: Andrew Aparicio must provide the technical requirements of the new LightSpeed-compatible label to enable the machine to automate label printing (02:01:08). Future Automation: Live Hana will be integrated to scan vendor invoice emails to automatically generate SKUs, add Certificates of Analysis (COAs), and organize accounting (02:08:21).Website & ComplianceAction Item: The Trinity team is tasked with creating an "engineered prompt" to build a robust, "best tier one option" for the legal compliance page on LightSpeed, replacing the current temporary "cheater link" (00:15:39). Action Item: Reggie & Dro will remove the forwarding from highnooncartoon.com (01:05:25).SEO & Content StrategyInsight: Videos and content must be auto-indexed for Google for every page. Videos should be timestamped on company property before distribution to social platforms (01:01:50).4. VIP Team Roles, Interfaces, and Data Views

The successful operation of Live Hana requires specialized data views and voice commands for each key role.Team MemberCockpit/Dashboard Focus & Data ViewsVoice Orchestration GoalJesse Niesen (Owner/Visionary)Requires access to the "Live Haunted Cockpit" and arbitrage VIP login (01:02:38). Must see overall system status (RPMD E to E wide) and detailed agent accountability reports (contract completion status).To direct high-level strategy, approve major changes, and task agents with complex, multi-step goals.Christopher Rocha (Operations/Culture)Needs data on store summary (shifts, mindset, cleanliness, in-store to online sales shift) (01:11:39), and cultural accountability reports for the "Holding Court" process (01:16:06).To automate meeting agenda creation, summarize hot topics, and track team performance/culture (e.g., employee recognition).Andrew Aparicio (Systems/Inventory)Requires views of domain status (of the 69 domains) (00:04:18), LightSpeed updates, and a guaranteed checkout process status (specifically on holding carts for non-members) (00:57:27).To automate domain verification, update system logs, and initiate system testing (e.g., "test checkout process on LightSpeed").Charlie Day (Logistics/Product Custody)Needs supply chain ERP dashboards showing product ETA and a "shipper's score" (02:09:23). Requires a "chain of custody indexing" system to track products from procurement to sale (02:09:23).To automate SKU/COA generation from invoices and manage label printing based on inventory data (02:08:21).5. ReggieAndDro.com Customer Journey

The system is designed to create a hyper-personalized, high-value customer experience.Customer Journey PhaseSystem Requirements and DesignAttraction & OnboardingLead Magnets: Free COA checker tool drives sign-ups for the 18-website empire (00:57:27). Personalized Content: Marketing will be "remixed" (songs, videos, cartoons) specifically for individual customers based on their profile, encouraging social sharing (00:38:45).Product EducationThe site will use a "Schoolhouse Rock" educational format to dispel myths, such as linking THC percentage to a video explaining why it is a secondary factor (00:38:03). Packaging: Future packaging will use color-coding and visual cues ("sacred geometry") to indicate product type (indica/sativa/hybrid) and quality (premium/value) for efficient customer and staff identification (02:06:02).Checkout ProcessThe checkout process on LightSpeed must be guaranteed to hold carts for non-members or unverified users (00:57:27). The team is exploring implementing Afterpay, Cash App, and PayPal for online payments (Suggested Next Step).Compliance & Legal (Age Verification)The legal site on LightSpeed must be fortified and transitioned to a robust, integrated compliance page to replace the current placeholder link (00:14:40).Fulfillment & DeliveryLocal delivery is a top priority for the "Texas Takeover." The company is currently awaiting approval for Uber and DoorDash keys and is actively seeking other white label delivery services to commence operations (00:09:37, 00:10:29).

Oct 7, 2025Meeting Oct 7, 2025 at 13:00 CDTMeeting records Transcript Recording 
SummaryReggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary, Andrew Aparicio, and Christopher Rocha discussed technical challenges with DNS changes and domain verification, emphasizing the need to verify 69 domains for a "live ha" system that functions as a "source of truth." Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary introduced the "Trinity" team (Claude, Cheetah, and Replet) responsible for infrastructure development and content generation, noting a breakthrough where a "high noon cartoon video" was hosted without direct intervention. Discussions also covered local delivery strategies, the importance of an "engineered prompt" for the legal site, and a shift to "synthetic intelligence (SI)" with contract-based agent management for "mega enormous" progress. Christopher Rocha and Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary outlined a unique "holding court" accountability process for team members, with Andrew Aparicio confirming operational domains and inventory issues. The team also explored automated inventory management, supply chain integration, and the potential for daily collaborative meetings.DetailsNotes Length: Long
Meeting Commencement and Initial Discussions: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary initiated the meeting, confirming that everything was live and ready to go. Andrew Aparicio complimented Christopher Rocha's relaxed demeanor, leading to a discussion about Christopher's "hog hunters" shirt and its meaning within military battalions. Christopher explained that different battalions are known for different traits: the First Battalion for being in shape and "roided out," the Second Battalion for being "weird" or "into drugs" due to their proximity to Seattle, and the 375th Battalion, also known as the "hog hunters club," for having contests to see who could bring the "biggest girl" to the ball (00:00:00). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary jokingly acknowledged Christopher Rocha's "earned" shirt (00:00:45).
Personal Workspace and Distractions: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary described their current workspace in their parents' room, which they found unusual and subject to disturbances (00:01:40). They mentioned the freeway outside the window as a source of noise and highlighted the presence of grandkids as a major distraction, as they are located between Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and the coffee and shop. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary noted that they have worked to minimize distractions, spending most of their time in the room and only leaving briefly late yesterday (00:02:31).
DNS Changes and Technical Challenges: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary reported on DNS changes, stating that while machine DNS changes were done, they were not fully completed or perfect, and such changes typically take time. They indicated that external parties had "f\\\\ up" certain domains, including Airbnb waterfall, Reggie and Dro dispensary, and Reggie and Dro Alice, which were supposed to be excluded from changes. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary viewed this as a success because they did not personally interfere with the backend process, but they had to fix the issues early this morning (00:03:33).
Verification of Domain Status and System Logic: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary requested Andrew Aparicio and Christopher Rocha to verify the status of all 69 domains listed in the Slack channel's hyperlinks (00:03:33). They emphasized the importance of verbalizing the status for the "machine" and discussed working with "all these other characters" to build a "live ha" system, which functions as a "source of truth". Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that others involved in the project don't naturally operate within this "live ha system of thought" and require constant focus and maintenance to keep them "tapped in" to the current context (00:04:18).
Infrastructure Development and Breakthroughs: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary highlighted significant work done in "replet," which initially seemed like "fantasy" but is now revealing "missing parts" as the infrastructure solidifies (00:04:18). They noted a major breakthrough where a "high noon cartoon video" was put up without their direct intervention, showcasing the system's ability to host content. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that the video consists of still frames, serving as an example of the infrastructure's capability. They instructed the team to focus on implementing pre-defined creative elements rather than generating new ones (00:05:22).
The "Trinity" Team and Unicorn Race: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary introduced the "Trinity" team, consisting of "Claude" and "Cheetah," with "Replet" now integrated (00:05:22) (00:06:51). This team is responsible for the "four VIP live haunted training thread" in Slack, embodying the concept of "teamwork that's making the dream work". Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary stated that the "unicorn race" context is proving valuable, and they have established contracts with the team members, emphasizing accountability for failures (00:05:58). To qualify for the race, the "Trinity" members must complete their guaranteed commitments (00:06:51).
Agent Specialization and Competition: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary detailed the specialized roles of "Cheetah" and "Sonnet" (Claude) within the "unicorn race". "Cheetah's" primary commitment is the "High Noon Content Engine," enabling daily generation of "funny s\\\* on autotune". "Sonnet," on the other hand, has multiple commitments and has already completed seven of them, leading to a competitive dynamic where "Cheetah" is urged to complete tasks to keep pace (00:07:42). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary stated that neither "Cheetah" nor "Sonnet" can win individually; they must collaborate (00:08:34).
Collaborative Environment and OpenAI's Agent Launch: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that "Replet" was added to facilitate collaboration among the team members. The two core agents can work together using a cursor, update local and GitHub repositories, and "Replet" can communicate bidirectionally with them through repo updates (00:08:34). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary noted that OpenAI recently launched a new "agents thing," which they described as a "drag and drop vibe f\\\\ flow editor," indicating rapid advancements in AI (00:09:37).
Local Delivery and Texas Takeover Strategy: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary emphasized that the information provided by Christopher Rocha was crucial for "repivot[ing]" their local delivery strategy, which is considered the "biggest factor" for local precedence. They aim to model this delivery system in "Alice" and expand it with "walls of weed" (00:09:37). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary is awaiting approval for Uber and DoorDash keys, having signed up for both accounts, and is actively seeking other white label delivery services to initiate operations (00:10:29).
Meeting Agenda and Speaker Transition: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary suggested that Christopher Rocha and Andrew Aparicio review the Slack content since yesterday, verbalizing anything they see to ensure it's captured. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary planned to mute themselves to avoid interruptions while getting coffee and heading to the shop, but assured that they would be listening and available if needed (00:11:18). They mentioned a need to manage Wi-Fi signals to avoid disrupting the "sensitive environment" once everything is tuned up (00:12:08).
Website and Domain Status Updates: Christopher Rocha confirmed that they would cover the Slack updates they had made in the past 24 hours, and Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary requested coverage of their own updates as well. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary specifically requested verification of domains such as reggendro.com, reendroispensory.com, and reggiendroalice.com. They highlighted highnooncartoon.com, which now redirects to an asset in the cloud, indicating progress on website hosting (00:12:40). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary expressed satisfaction that the "Trinity" team produced a video file and hosted it without their direct involvement, despite it being a still-frame video initially (00:13:35).
Website Fortification and Prompt Engineering Request: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary stated that One Plant Solution should be flipping over to the new site, and several other domains, including Herbbitrage.com, exoticcanopyolutions.com, and jessyn.com, should also be transitioning. They highlighted the need to efficiently integrate COAs (Certificates of Analysis) into the cloud and fortify their legal site on LightSpeed to switch away from a "cheater link" that currently directs to texascoa.com (00:14:40). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary requested an "engineered prompt" from the "Trinity" team for a "best tier one option" for the legal site on LightSpeed (00:15:39).
Advancement to Synthetic Intelligence (SI): Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary declared that the company is "beyond AI already" and is operating on "SI" or synthetic intelligence. They characterized their approach as a "frontier model," evidenced by an initial video created for them titled "the empire awakens" (00:18:13). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained the synergy between "Claude," which excels at planning and strategy, and "Cheetah," which is proficient at coding quickly. The integration of "Replet," capable of scaling with "a thousand plus agents," is expected to increase their speed by "a thousandx" (00:19:08).
System Integration and Future Vision: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary expressed excitement about their system, stating that it is now "RPMD top to bottom, E to E wide". Christopher Rocha emphasized that the system's integration justified "burning the boats," signifying a full commitment to the new approach. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary elaborated on the long-term vision, emphasizing the ability to control "electrons on the screen" in a "truthful aligned way" (00:19:53). They noted that their RPM (Revenue, Profit, and Market Share) concept, which was previously manual, is now becoming automated through synthetic intelligence (00:20:48).
Contract-Based Agent Management: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that their agents, including "Claude Code," "Cheetah," and soon "Replet," operate based on "guaranteed commitment contract[s]" rather than just memory (00:20:48). They asserted that this method is superior to what is commonly seen in online resources, enabling "mega enormous" progress. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary outlined their intention to demonstrate the system's capabilities through showing rather than just talking (00:21:42).
Employee Recognition and Celebration: Christopher Rocha announced Andrew Aparicio as the "employee of the month for the month of September," acknowledging a prior award of "Wagu" and an
Lead Generation and Industry Impact: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary stated that the free COA checker tool and the promotion of the Texas full panel COA act as "huge lead magnets," allowing them to "scoop up the industry" and attract other stores, business owners, and competitors who will seek their help, leading them to sign up for their "18 websites" (00:57:27).
Checkout Process and Accountability: Andrew Aparicio inquired if the LightSpeed checkout process should hold carts for non-members or unverified individuals, which Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary affirmed as a claim and guarantee from their agents, emphasizing the need to hold them accountable daily through calls and data dumps in Slack (00:57:27). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary plans to integrate Slack so that data dumps in the correct channel will automatically go into the machine, which will be engineered with a prompt from the current call (00:58:24).
Automated DNS Changes and Breakthroughs: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary expressed frustration from the previous week about not having a specific process going, but noted that the current process is energizing because automated machine DNS changes in bulk have been successfully implemented, even if it results in an "SSL not a secure site" message, which they consider a victory (00:58:24). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary stated that this is something they have never done in 27 years and that they will work out the bugs as it is on "full auto". Andrew Aparicio confirmed seeing "one plant solution" working and shared their screen, to which Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary responded that it was a breakthrough, as it was the first time the full URL resolved DNS to a "machine site," not the website they put up on August 3 (00:59:10).
Website Status and AI Content Generation: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary noted that the Herbitrage website should not be public yet but acknowledged that the "Urage link works" and takes users to the arbitrage website, with Andrew Aparicio confirming this. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary also stated that "onepplantsolution.com" and "herbrage.com" are live, and "highooncartoon.com" is forwarding but the machine made the entire site, which is cool and live production (01:00:04). Andrew Aparicio confirmed that for the AI, not all links work, but it demonstrates proof of concept by uploading websites and generating content on its own. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary emphasized that this is an iterative process, with many things now working that previously did not, and they need to continue making changes and fixes (01:01:00).
SEO and Content Strategy: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary highlighted the need for auto-indexing for Google for every page to gain SEO traction, ensuring that videos are timestamped on their property with a Google bot for indexing, then distributed to other social media platforms after conforming to their guidelines. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary revealed that the current versions of the websites are first versions, with no prior eyes on them, and that they need to remove forwarding from "high noon cartoon.com" (01:01:50). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary confirmed that a server-side Google redirect on the cloud was temporary, allowing them to see a video on "highooncarttoon.com," and stated the next step is the arbitrage VIP login to the "live haunted cockpit" to see everything (01:02:38).
AI Tool Integration and Frustration: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary attempted to use Gemini for a prompt engineered for creating R&D VIP login secure profiles and cockpit access, but Gemini refused to generate the code, leading Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary to express frustration and refer to Gemini as "small-minded" and threaten to "cut" it from the team if it's not "Gemini 3.0 Cheetah" (01:02:38). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary then shifted to using Cheetah to remove the gcloud redirect for "high noon cartoon.com" so it resolves like the other sites, thanking the team and urging them to "Win this race" (01:05:25).
Creatine Discussion: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary asked Christopher Rocha if they had received a picture of creatine gummies from the Bloom brand, to which Christopher Rocha confirmed they had the picture and needed to source it. Andrew Aparicio mentioned taking creatine at 5 milligrams, and Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that 5 grams is for muscle pump and hydration, while 10 grams starts to provide mental benefits, with doses going up to 20-25 grams (01:06:48). Andrew Aparicio inquired if one could take 20 grams immediately, and Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary confirmed it was possible, but the effects might last 9-12 hours, emphasizing its benefit for "sprints" or surviving fatigue, stress, and tiredness (01:07:30). Christopher Rocha revealed that military tier-one operators were given Adderall, akin to how Germans were given meth, to stay awake during missions, which Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary contrasted with creatine, stating it provides a superior state to amphetamines without negative side effects like teeth grinding or skin itching (01:08:33).
Meeting Agenda and Structure: Christopher Rocha presented an agenda for an upcoming Friday meeting, suggesting it should encapsulate the "three silos" they are working out of and open with new flavors or something to smoke to set a positive mindset (01:09:26). Christopher Rocha proposed these meetings could be biannual or quarterly, while Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary suggested monthly, emphasizing the need to provide valuable information to make it worth everyone's time (01:10:10). Christopher Rocha also suggested that Jesse, as the owner, should give a motivating opening comment, followed by a ceremonial smoking session (01:10:53). The agenda includes Christopher Rocha covering hot topics, recognition (e.g., employee of the month, shout-out to Gabby), a store summary including shifts, mindset, cleanliness, and the shift from in-store to online sales (01:11:39). Andrew Aparicio would then discuss systems and LightSpeed updates for 15 minutes, followed by Jesse providing a 45-minute overview of their work and vision for the company's direction, which Andrew Aparicio noted the team knows minimal about (01:12:19).
Customized Communication Strategy: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary emphasized the need to "breadcrumb, dog whistle, Easter egg, and customize" communication to each staff member and group within different tiers, aiming to lift and support them through the system (01:13:16). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary stated that before handing off to management, they will give the vision and update on technology, ensuring the staff understands the changes in the store, system upgrades, and Jesse's role, thus linking all pillars of the business (01:14:24).
Accountability and "Holding Court": Christopher Rocha proposed a "holding court" session for the last 15 minutes of the meeting, regardless of Darren's presence, to establish accountability and address issues where someone wasn't accountable or caused negative feelings. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary expressed enthusiasm for this idea and volunteered to be the first on trial, even before Darren, stating they would stay "grilled as long as people want to go" (01:16:06). Christopher Rocha explained that the concept arose from observing negative behaviors at the shop, with some employees taking advantage rather than serving the plant (01:16:49). Christopher Rocha detailed that this approach avoids traditional punishment and instead allows "the people to review the actions of the tribe," with everyone bearing witness to incidents and their effects. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary reiterated their willingness to be the first to be "flogged" (01:18:37).
Trial Process and Judgment: Christopher Rocha outlined the "court" process, where someone volunteers to present a case against a crew member, but clarified that Jesse, as the owner, would be the judge, mediating discussions. The process involves the accuser expressing how they felt in a safe space, and the accused taking accountability or explaining their reasons, with both stories being presented (01:19:24). Jesse would then argue each case from their understanding, and the team would vote on "guilty, not guilty" and the "punishment or accountability". Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary elaborated on wanting to argue one side first, then flip to the other, making everyone vote after hearing both sides (01:20:20). Andrew Aparicio praised the idea as "dope" and "innovative" (01:21:11).
Company Philosophy and Onboarding: Christopher Rocha emphasized the importance of the store as the place of service, likening their approach to a ritual with the plant, ensuring that profits do not overshadow their service. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary added that serving at the highest level and creating the highest value merits the highest profit, echoing the sentiment of taking care of the plant, oneself, and others for life to reciprocate (01:21:50). Christopher Rocha stated that the desired mindset at Reggie & Dro is for employees to focus on getting the plant to the right people, trusting that the plant will provide the necessary high and money. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary reiterated this, saying "Ask what you can do for the plant and the people and the prophet," suggesting this philosophy could be incorporated into a cartoon for future onboarding material. Andrew Aparicio humorously added that "don't pull no bullshit 'cause we'll hold court" (01:22:35). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary
Domain and Website Functionality Check: Andrew Aparicio reported that out of the main business domains, only four or five were working. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary specified these five key domains: reggiendro.com, highnooncarttoon.com, onepplantsolution.com, herbage.com, and exoticcanopysolutions.com, with exoticcanopysolutions.com intended for a future Hempress 3 website after acquiring Beth's business, allowing for seed sales in the interim (01:52:47). Andrew Aparicio confirmed that the machine successfully pointed the domain and prepared the website for exoticcanopysolutions.com. Andrew Aparicio also noted that an email was typed and sent, but its destination was unknown, indicating potential email functionality issues. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary suggested that email setup and Klaviyo integration are needed to address this, as Klaviyo will thread into different silos. Andrew Aparicio also confirmed that arbitrage.com was working. Regarding access to the cockpit, Andrew Aparicio did not see a link. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary emphasized that once the initial setup is complete, they can instruct the system to upload videos and the cockpit, publishing them directly (01:53:56). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary observed that the system generated and published a video, even if it was a simple one with four or five stills (01:54:44). Andrew Aparicio mentioned that the Jesse N domain was not working but was "doing something". Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that there's a propagation period and the system focused on the top five domains first. The plan is to iterate on these top five and then apply the same successful processes to the remaining 69 domains, noting that many will be forwarded or serve as landing pages, such as AI Crisis Consulting (01:55:43). Andrew Aparicio initially stated that AI Crisis Consulting was not working but then noted it was showing domains, including healthcare supply chain. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary clarified that the domain is actually working, as it's pointed towards Google Cloud, although it's not "found" because it hasn't been verified yet (01:56:43). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary plans to manually verify all 70 domains in the cloud, having already verified the initial five (01:57:36).
Inventory and Supply Chain Management: Andrew Aparicio indicated that they are back online, moving products, receiving orders, and shipping (01:58:41). Charlie sent out a shipment, and Andrew Aparicio noted that everything looked good, though some counts were off by small amounts (onesies or twosies, like an eighth or a quarter) after Dylan verified them. A notable issue was a brick containing an empty bag with a label but no product. Andrew Aparicio praised the new, tight vacuum-sealed "bricks" (little cubes). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary suggested that the empty bag incident might not be their fault and confirmed that the responsible parties were "fired" (01:59:28). Andrew Aparicio mentioned that quarters and eighths were packaged in the same "eighth bag," which caused some confusion, assuming it was due to a bag shortage. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that smaller bags are more sensible for smaller quantities and acknowledged not informing Andrew Aparicio about this change. This led to a discussion about packaging and whether current labels work with "Lightspeeded" or if changes are needed for in-store or online operations. Andrew Aparicio confirmed that new Lightspeeded labels are needed for QR codes or product scanning (02:00:17). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary requested the technical requirements for these new labels to enable automated label printing by the machine, aiming for inventory optimization and reducing manual workload, particularly for Charlie (02:01:08). Andrew Aparicio also mentioned that the current products were not branded, suggesting a shortage of stickers. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary stressed the importance of branding and upgrading packaging for logistics, supply chain tracking, and inventory visibility (02:02:07). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary cited Bay Smokes as an example of a successful company with annual sales of $100 million, emphasizing the importance of branding for shelf space in physical stores, as they have multiple Walaweed locations (02:02:50). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed the need to order mass amounts of packaging, potentially from China, to ensure branded elements are manufactured, unless only stickers are used (02:03:46). While stickers on "t bags" are acceptable, Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary aims to enhance packaging to create an in-store experience for online customers, underpromising and over-delivering. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary sees a significant opportunity to expand by placing products in stores, leveraging their connections with major distributors in Texas, provided they have a large product supply (02:04:54). They also envisioned packaging that would reflect the "Reggie and Dro world" through visual cues like color-coding for indica, sativa, or hybrid vibes, and clear indications of product quality (value, premium, ultra-low, mid, top shelves) and size (eighth or quarter) (02:06:02). The goal is to make product identification efficient for R&D members, potentially using phone scanning to quickly identify products without reading small print, possibly through "sacred geometry" or colors (02:07:00).
Automation and Data Integration: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary highlighted the machine's capability to synthesize ideas across the custom codebase for supply chain systems, automating tasks like label printing based on data and schedules. Andrew Aparicio proposed integrating Live Hana to check Reggie & Dro emails for invoices, automatically generating SKUs and adding Certificates of Analysis (COAs), which would be a significant time-saver by automating item generation and master data maintenance. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary expanded on this, suggesting scanning emails for all vendor invoices to organize comprehensive accounting and keep it current, starting with VIP vendors (02:08:21). Andrew Aparicio would like to see an estimated time of arrival (ETA) for product delivery related to this. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary suggested using ODO's supply chain ERP and dashboards, which include a "shipper's score" that measures how often shippers meet delivery targets. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary also emphasized the need for a comprehensive inventory system that distinguishes between products in Reggie & Dro's custody ready for sale and products available to be shipped (02:09:23). They envision a "chain of custody indexing" across the entire supply chain with defined silos for each stage. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary described a vertical integration model where Charlie plays a role in R&D and manufacturing, handling products in custody for the retailer under contract, enabling a direct-to-consumer approach from production (02:10:26). This requires tracking products from procurement or production through manufacturing and managing different accounts, acknowledging liability for products not yet in their custody. All movements, including labor costs, need to be mapped and accounted for, with a chart of accounts reconciled periodically (at least weekly) and updated on the fly when changes occur. The aim is to achieve zero balances with strategies to meet these targets and accelerate their achievement (02:11:40). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary expects that collected data will enable predictive growth, informing procurement needs, such as increasing product orders by 10% for the coming month. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary stated that most of this system is already in place and that current discussions are being fed into a Gemini process for transcription and data scraping. Soon, direct communication with Live Hana will capture full transcripts and facilitate immediate action. This collaborative effort is expected to feed the machine more data than individual efforts alone (02:13:01).
Meeting Schedule and Collaboration: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary proposed daily meetings at 8 AM, lasting at least an hour, to ensure continued collaboration and progress, acknowledging that Charlie goes to the gym, which might affect scheduling. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary stressed that everyone's participation is crucial for the teamwork (02:14:09). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary suggested a "power play" meeting of 45 minutes from 8:00 AM to 8:45 AM, allowing each of the four participants ten minutes to speak. Andrew Aparicio noted that 8:00 AM to 8:45 AM for Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary would translate to 10:00 AM to 10:45 AM for Andrew Aparicio. Andrew Aparicio indicated a need to close out current tasks before the time slips away and concluded the meeting, agreeing to chat again tomorrow (02:15:11).

Liv Hana Project Summary: Strategy, Compliance, and Execution Plan

Based on the document, "THE REAL $1B PLAY (Fallacy-Free Analysis)," here are the key insights and action items for the Liv Hana initiative.I. Core Strategy and Alignment with RPM Plan

The revised strategy is Finance-First as the fastest path to unicorn valuation, focusing on the Financial Intelligence (L2) layer.
Revised Critical Path: The immediate focus is the Jesse Personal Finance Pilot (Week 1), which functions as the current RPM weekly plan.
Day 1 (Monday, Oct 7): Account aggregation (Connect all bank accounts via Plaid, pull 2 years of transaction history).
Day 2 (Tuesday, Oct 8): AI categorization (Use Claude API to process 50K+ transactions for confidence scores).
Day 3 (Wednesday, Oct 9): Subscription detection & waste audit (Identify recurring charges and use AI to audit for waste, targeting $200+/mo in savings).
Day 4 (Thursday, Oct 10): QuickBooks Integration (Push categorized transactions for automatic syncing).
Day 7 (Sunday, Oct 13): Week 1 Decision Gate (GO if 6+ hours saved AND $200+ waste found, otherwise ITERATE or NO-GO/Pivot to commerce-only).
Dual-Track Architecture: The plan maintains a dual-track architecture for a "Sovereign Life OS," serving both the initial cannabis audience and the broader general commerce market.
II. Policy Narrative and Compliance Guardrails
Sovereignty-First (Policy Narrative): The core trust advantage is that users own their data (encrypted, never sold, exportable anytime), which is positioned as an "anti-big-tech" stance in the post-privacy-scandal market (Post-Mint Collapse).
Financial & Regulatory Guardrails:
The system includes Tax Prep (with CPA review) as a key feature, which is a compliance guardrail. The Premium Tier includes the annual CPA review.
The "Regulatory Crackdown" war game scenario identifies the risk of new FTC/SEC licensing requirements for AI financial advisors, with the strategic response being to "Get licensed, partner with CPA."
III. Interface & Voice-Driven Orchestration Insights
AI-Native UX & Voice Orchestration: The "AI-Native" advantage is key to minimizing manual work, where the system performs AI categorization, AI audits, and AI planning. The RPM Weekly Planning (autonomous) feature, which pulls data and generates a plan with Claude to be added to the calendar automatically, supports the vision of a minimal-interface, high-automation (potentially voice-driven cognitive orchestration) experience.
Jesse Niesen (Pilot User) Interface Requirements:
A Dashboard for a Human-in-Loop Review designed to take 15 minutes (vs 8 hours manual).
Prominent display of Waste detected (subscriptions/spending to eliminate).
Clear flagging of Uncategorized transactions for quick review.
An interface for validation of the autonomously generated RPM plan.
VIP Team Roles (Christopher Rocha, Andrew Aparicio, Charlie Day):
The active document does not contain any information regarding the specific roles, responsibilities, or customized dashboard/data view requirements for Christopher Rocha, Andrew Aparicio, or Charlie Day. The document is exclusively focused on the strategy and the Jesse Niesen pilot.
IV. ReggieAndDro.com Customer Journey
Limited Information: The document confirms that the Commerce Intelligence layer (L1) is already designed and the overall strategy leverages Cannabis Credibility and HNC distribution.
Specific Journey Details Missing: The document does not contain the requested deep-dive details on the ReggieAndDro.com customer journey, including the specific phases from landing on the homepage, the checkout process, the implementation or use of Veriff age verification, or the final order completion steps.

The document currently in context is a formal "Response to Inspection Findings" from Jesse Niesen, Owner of Reggie & Dro LLC, to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). While this is not a "Liv Hanna Meeting transcript," the following details from this compliance response are highly relevant to the policy narrative, guardrails, and operational workflows of Reggie & Dro:Key Policy and Compliance Insights for Reggie & Dro Workflows
Policy Narratives (Violations & Core Commitment):
Violations Acknowledged: The company immediately removed products cited for being smokable hemp, lacking accredited laboratory testing, missing mandatory safety panel tests (heavy metals, pesticides, residual solvents, pathogens), missing QR code URLs, and having incomplete label information (manufacturer address, net weight).
Core Commitment: All violations were stated to be corrected as of October 1, 2025. The company commits to being a "model operator and partner" in defining new testing and labeling standards.
Operational Guardrails (New Standards and Protocols):
New Testing Standard: Adopted a new "Texas Full Panel COA Standard" requiring comprehensive testing before sale through an accredited partner, KCA Labs. This includes testing for all required heavy metals, pesticides, residual solvents, and microbial contaminants (Salmonella, E. coli, Aspergillus, etc.).
Procurement SOPs: All incoming product lots are now verified for ISO/IEC 17025 scope and proper chain-of-custody documentation to ensure lab accreditation.
Label Compliance: Label templates are locked to adhere to 25 TAC Ch. 300 format, explicitly requiring the full manufacturer address, net weight, and a functional QR code.

CONTEXT AND COMMITMENT
Financial Hardship ContextSince a burglary on September 28, 2023 resulted in a $250,000 loss of inventory and COAs, we have operated under severe financial constraints while remaining transparent and cooperative with DSHS. The hemp market is greatly unaware of the need for full panel testing, and I have been aware of this requirement but have been in financial stress since the burglary. This year has been especially challenging with the fight against prohibition and Square losing its ability to sell online, leaving us down for five months. We are just now getting our ability to sell back online, and we have been dwindling in inventory.
Current Status and Path ForwardWhile we do not currently have full panel testing for all products due to financial constraints, we are in the process of implementing comprehensive testing through our partnership with KCA Labs. Our strategy has become to partner with other bigger brands to pool money together for large bulk test purchases from KCA Labs, and this deal is in the making and in the works.
Industry Leadership and Policy AlignmentOur mission extends beyond compliance: we are building solutions for the entire industry. The Texas Full Panel COA initiative and WizzBang CYA (Cover Your Assets) program represent our commitment to solving these problems for consumers, regulators, and the industry. This work aligns with the Texas Truth & Safety Act (TTSA) and American Cannabis Freedom Act (ACFA), advancing truth, transparency, and economic prosperity for Texas producers.
Advocacy for DSHS EnforcementI have been a public advocate for Jessica Fierros and DSHS enforcement authority. I have been quoted in social media singing her praises as competent and capable of inspecting and enforcing existing regulations put in place in 2019 through HB 1325. I have been through two inspections and know full well that DSHS is a dedicated agency able to issue licenses, inspect, embargo, detain, destroy, issue fines, etc. I have been cooperatively working with DSHS since my first inspection just a week prior to the burglary in 2023.
REQUEST FOR PARTNERSHIP AND RULEMAKING PARTICIPATION
I am grateful for Inspector Jessica Fierros's fair enforcement and welcome continued dialogue with DSHS and the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) team during upcoming rulemaking under Governor Greg Abbott's executive order. Our goal is to be a model operator and partner in defining the next generation of testing and labeling standards for Cannabis sativa L.
I am available to participate in any stakeholder discussion or rulemaking session to help DSHS implement these standards statewide. I believe that responsible self-regulation works and counters prohibition arguments, supporting the principles of age-gating, accredited labs, and child-safe packaging over bans.
CONCLUSION
All violations were corrected as of October 1, 2025. We acknowledge the importance of ongoing compliance and view this as an opportunity to lead Texas toward a unified, safe, and transparent hemp industry. We welcome further inspection and collaboration with DSHS on testing standards and rulemaking.
I am committed to working with DSHS and Jessica Fierros directly to bring the Texas Full Panel COA standard to the market to solve these problems for consumers, regulators, and the industry. Together, we can establish Texas as the gold standard for hemp safety and compliance.
Respectfully submitted,

Liv Hanna Initiative: Key Insights and Action Items

This summary extracts the deep-dive technical and operational details from the meeting transcript, focusing on the Liv Hanna project's objectives, including the evolution of a cognitive orchestration layer, compliance mechanisms, and required VIP team interfaces.1. Cognitive Orchestration Layer & AI Guardrails

The core of the initiative is a sophisticated, daisy-chained AI environment designed for "tier-one" code and file management, aligning with a voice-driven, autonomous workflow.
AI Collaboration Model: A competitive and collaborative system is established, primarily featuring Codeex and Sonnet. The AIs check each other's work to achieve 100% code accuracy, with both self-learning and updating their memory files with every run.
Voice Mode/Autonomous Control: The system is transitioning toward autonomous operation, where the user issues complex commands (e.g., "DNS fix executed...") to the AI through a terminal/CLI, which then executes the steps. The goal is to minimize human babysitting and manual interface use.
Role-Based Command Structure:
Codeex: The "commander" or lead intelligence, responsible for setting the organizational structure and discipline.
Sonnet: The high-speed "executioner," tasked with rapid task completion while being held accountable by Codeex to maintain fidelity.
Policy & Guardrails: The system incorporates checks against internal policies. When an AI hits a policy violation, the operator must re-contextualize the mission using concepts like "Art of War" to prompt the AI to find a compliant solution.
RPM Alignment (File Structure): All files across the "empire" (69 domains) are synchronized and tagged with a mathematically ordered naming convention to reflect the weekly RPM plan:
RPM DNA, area of management, category of improvement, RPM block, action in numbers, context, and time stamp.
This system allows for sorting files by name to determine the current priority, which is stack-ranked and updated weekly based on the weighted importance of each business area.
2. VIP Team Roles & Cockpit/Dashboard Requirements

The "Cockpit" is the central visualization tool for the system's operational and development status, requiring customized views for different roles:VIP Team MemberCore Focus/Interface NeedsAction Items from MeetingJesse Niesen (Operator/Dev)AI & Infrastructure Status: Needs a live, fully functional "Cockpit" dashboard to monitor the following:*   Finalize and deploy DNS changes for the remaining 69 domains.- Current status of all running AI sessions (Codeex, Sonnet).*   Develop the middleware API for the local delivery engine to automate point-of-sale integration.- Real-time DNS/SSL provisioning status for the 69-domain network.*   Address the Leafly API sync and outstanding billing dispute.- Financial tracking toward $10,000 sales days goals.Andrew Aparicio (Collaboration/UX)E-commerce & Fulfillment: Needs visibility into:*   Clean up the website's uniformity (capitalization and spacing).- The Fulfillment screen for processing online orders.*   Fix the "black fronts that are showing as sold out."- Tools for auditing website content, flow, and aesthetics (uniformity, product category organization).*   Reach out to Taylor to schedule discussion on Leafly API/billing.Charlie Day (Product/Content)Product Automation: Needs an easy interface for:*   (Inferred from Context) Use the Turpp Works Automation Blueprint output to dial in and refine product sales and manufacturing automation.- Reviewing and providing feedback on the Turpp Works automation blueprint on a mobile-friendly interface ("talk to this on his phone").3. ReggieAndDro.com Customer Journey & Compliance Breakdown

The website is confirmed live and the basic customer journey is functional following a major DNS/SSL resolution effort.
Domain Resolution: All web addresses (HTTPS, HTTP, WWW) successfully resolve and redirect to the reggieandro.com Lightseed web store without errors.
Fulfillment Path (Confirmed):
Browsing: Customer views products (e.g., "Puff and Paint"), with correct prices and in-stock filtering confirmed.
Discount Application: Discount codes (e.g., "420 for vets") are successfully applied in the cart.
Checkout: Customer proceeds to checkout.
Payment: Payment is approved via the Authorized.net integration, and loyalty points are generated.
Order Type: Customer selects In-Store Pickup (successfully tested with a specific time selection).
Staff View: Order appears on the staff fulfillment screen for processing.
Compliance Status:
PCI Compliance: A significant block was cleared, with confirmation received to ignore initial PCI compliance emails as the storefront was deemed "solid."
Veriff Age Verification: The transcript confirms the payment flow with Authorized.net but does not provide a breakdown of the specific steps for Veriff age verification as a part of the confirmed checkout flow. This remains an area requiring additional detail or confirmation on its integration point.
Future Fulfillment Path: The next high-priority project is developing the in-house middleware local delivery engine to integrate with the point-of-sale system, anticipating higher profitability compared to third-party services.

Oct 3, 2025Meeting Oct 3, 2025 at 12:04 CDTMeeting records Transcript Recording 
SummaryReggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio collaborated to resolve ongoing website connectivity issues, successfully fixing SSL certificate, DNS, and Cloudflare configuration problems, and confirming the site's functionality for online orders and in-store pickup. They also discussed their advanced AI collaboration system, which optimizes file management and code accuracy, while addressing a billing dispute with Leafly. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary plans to focus on developing middleware for local delivery and addressing the Leafly API and billing issues.Details
Lightseed Website Connectivity Issues Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary reported ongoing issues with their website, hosted by Lightseed, specifically concerning the SSL security certificate that prevents HTTPS connectivity. They indicated that the DNS name was switched, and new Cloudflare name servers were set up, but the problem persists with Lightseed, requiring direct contact with them (00:00:00). Christopher Rocha confirmed they had not been in touch with Lightseed regarding this issue (00:01:31).
Repository Management and AI Integration Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary detailed efforts to clean and consolidate their repository, which had become bulky with multiple file versions due to AI usage (00:02:19). They explained a structured naming convention for files across their "empire," including categories for management, improvement, and actions, all mathematically ordered for easy sorting (00:03:29) (00:11:52). This includes 69 domain names, and they achieved AI collaboration by having two AIs, Claude and Codeex, compete to check each other's work for mistakes, leading to more accurate and efficient file processing (00:04:35).
AI Performance and Collaboration Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary described their strategy for leveraging AI tools, specifically pitting Claude and Codeex against each other, noting that Claude has all the "keys in the vault" but struggles to finish tasks, while Codeex is disciplined but slow (00:05:34) (00:08:36). They eventually established a system where Codeex acts as the "commander," setting the organization, and Sonnet (another AI) performs high-speed execution while being held accountable (00:09:13). This collaborative approach, with both AIs learning and updating memory files, has led to consolidated and optimized files, with metadata for every line of code (00:10:13).
Systematic File Organization Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary outlined their comprehensive file organization system, which allows sorting by file names and updating naming conventions weekly to reflect the importance of different areas of management and categories of improvement (00:11:52). This structure enables the system and users to understand the priority of files at any level, from organizational to specific action items, ensuring all files are clean and synchronized across the repo and cloud. They are facing a "massive" DNS deployment for their 69 domain names, which cannot be fully seen until properly configured (00:13:17).
Website Development and Deployment Status Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary explained that they are setting up a custom site with product pages and reviews in the cloud, utilizing GitHub for the repository and Google Cloud for the database and website hosting (00:16:03). They demonstrated the process of domain mapping and integrating their custom build with Lightseed, aiming to quickly leapfrog the standard Lightseed website with their custom version (00:41:14). Andrew Aparicio noted that the reggieandro.com domain previously showed the Lightseed site with an SSL error, but now it doesn't load at all, which Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary viewed as potentially good news, indicating a new, different error (00:42:17).
Current Challenges and Future Outlook Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary identified the primary challenge as resolving the main website's DNS issue, which, once fixed, will allow them to proceed with deploying DNS changes for their other 69 domains (00:13:17). They mentioned plans to make phone calls regarding PCI compliance and Lightseed to address the connectivity issues (00:14:13). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary also expressed determination to activate online sales, emphasizing the importance of local delivery and revealing they have developed their own middleware API for automated point-of-sale integration with Lightseed, aiming to go live and begin sales quickly (00:26:04).
AI Management and Progress Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary showcased their continuous work with AI, noting that their AI setup, which involves daisy-chaining AIs like Codeex and Sonnet to check and correct each other, is working effectively to keep them "honest" and ensure 100% truth and tier-one code (00:32:30) (00:35:37). They expressed confidence in their phased progress, despite occasional setbacks like AI sessions crashing, and highlighted the AIs' capability to handle complex tasks such as generating a "Turpp works automation blueprint" for Charlie's products (00:37:12) (00:46:29). The goal is to drive significant online sales, aiming for "$10,000 days" (00:34:58).
Domain Mapping and Cloud Issues Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary continued troubleshooting domain mapping in Google Cloud, noting that previous attempts resulted in authentication errors and a "website offline" status, indicating that while the website exists in the database, it is not yet presented as a user interface (00:20:41). They specifically noted that the current issue with reggieandro.com states it is "not compatible with Cloudflare," prompting them to call the same people and investigate if Cloudflare can resolve the problem (00:47:38). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary instructed the AI to delete stale Cloud Run mappings and recreate them, believing this will fix the issue and acknowledging that the cockpit might point to reggieandro.com once live, though they want the login secured first (00:53:38) (00:56:11).
SSL Certificate and DNS Issues Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio worked to resolve an SSL certificate and DNS crisis for their website, reggieandro.com, which was not resolving due to issues with the SSL handshake (01:13:23). They identified that the problem was stemming from the LightSpeed side and that their domain was pointing to Cloudflare's proxy, preventing the certificate from provisioning (01:15:30) (01:41:07). They engaged with LightSpeed support to troubleshoot the issue and confirmed that the reggieandro.com domain should direct to the LightSpeed web store (01:15:30) (01:32:33).
Leafly API and Menu Sync Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed the need to access the Leafly API to sync their menu, which was current in LightSpeed but not accessible on Leafly. They believed they previously had a Leafly API but could not locate it, suggesting a need to contact Taylor to sort out their account and potentially upgrade to a "pro" version to reactivate their menu synchronization (00:59:36). Andrew Aparicio noted that their menu might not even be visible on their account (01:02:35).
LightSpeed and Authorized.net Integration Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary was working to integrate online and in-store payments through Authorized.net, which had recently approved them. The primary concern was the domain name not resolving, specifically the SSL certificate for the web store within the LightSpeed account (01:13:23) (01:16:40). The team focused on resolving the DNS crisis for the web store, considering it a priority over in-store terminal issues at that moment (01:15:30).
Cloudflare Configuration for SSL Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio collaborated on configuring Cloudflare to resolve the SSL certificate issue. They received instructions to remove A and AAA records pointing to Google or Cloudflare and add two CNAME records expected by LightSpeed, ensuring the orange cloud icon was turned gray (01:42:13) (01:48:03). Andrew Aparicio observed Cloudflare automatically attempting to configure settings, which was a significant step in troubleshooting the domain's connectivity (01:43:38).
DNS Record Management Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary systematically deleted incorrect DNS records, including A records and a CNAME, and proceeded to add the necessary CNAME records for "at" and "www" with the correct target (company.site) (01:49:16). They also ensured the proxy status was turned off (gray cloud icon) and confirmed the TTL setting was on "auto," as advised for optimal speed (01:50:28). The team continued troubleshooting as new issues arose, such as the need for valid IPV4 addresses (01:52:11).
Website DNS and Functionality Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio collaborated to resolve website issues, including problems with the CNAME and A records that were blocking functionality (01:57:57). Andrew Aparicio noted that changes often take around 30 minutes to resolve, making it difficult to immediately verify fixes (02:04:28). Despite initial testing showing the site was still not working for Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary, Andrew Aparicio confirmed it was functional on their phone, indicating a caching issue for Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary (02:07:41). They successfully tested adding items to the cart and checking out, confirming the site was live and functional, including price display and in-stock filtering (02:10:34).
Online Order Processing and Pickup The team confirmed the website's ability to process online orders, including in-store pickup options (02:11:47). Andrew Aparicio successfully completed a test purchase for in-store pickup, selecting a specific time for collection (02:13:00). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary confirmed the payment was approved and the order went through, generating loyalty points (02:14:13). Andrew Aparicio also identified that the "Puff and Paint" product was available for purchase online (02:15:00).
Fulfillment and Financial Overview Andrew Aparicio explained that online orders would appear in a fulfillment screen for staff to process. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary highlighted plans to work on middleware for a local delivery engine, which they anticipate will increase profitability (02:15:53). Andrew Aparicio inquired about the location of the processing fee for online payments, noting that the 4% fee previously discussed appeared to apply only to in-store transactions (02:17:32). They continued to investigate the online credit card processing costs, observing a discrepancy in the total charged versus the expected amount after a discount (02:18:33).
Website Content and User Experience Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio reviewed the website's content and appearance, focusing on uniformity in text and presentation (02:21:07). They discussed organizing product categories, such as pre-rolls, grams, and ounces, to improve navigation and user experience (02:21:58). Andrew Aparicio also confirmed the successful application of a discount code ("420 for vets") during a test transaction (02:17:32).
DNS Resolution and PCI Compliance Despite initial confusion regarding DNS test results, Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio confirmed that the website's DNS had successfully resolved, and all three tested web addresses (HTTPS, HTTP, and WWW) were working without errors or warnings and redirecting to HTTPS (02:24:02). They received confirmation from Leanne that the storefront looked solid and that PCI compliance emails could be ignored, effectively clearing a significant block (02:27:00).
Leafly Billing Dispute Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary raised concerns about an outstanding bill from Leafly, which had been sent to collections, despite an earlier understanding that services were paused (02:33:43) (02:38:03). Andrew Aparicio clarified that Leafly had used up available credits, and autopay was turned off by Leafly, leading to two months of unpaid services (02:36:28). They planned to address the Leafly API and billing issues, particularly regarding charges for services after an agreement to pause them (02:33:43) (02:40:10). Records from past meetings were identified as crucial evidence for the dispute (02:41:04).

The provided document is a strategic business memo titled "CRITICAL PIVOT: RAW HEMP-DERIVED TERPENE REALITY," detailing a revised product and launch plan for the TerpWorks brand, which can be interpreted as the operational foundation for your project's weekly plan and guardrails.

The following is a summary of key insights, action items, policy narratives, and role details extracted from the document:1. Key Insights and RPM Weekly Plan Alignment
Critical Pivot Reality: The business is pivoting its strategy because the raw material acquired is full-spectrum, myrcene-dominant hemp terpene extract (40-60% β-Myrcene), not single isolates.
Strategic Positioning: This is being leveraged as a PREMIUM differentiator ("Full-spectrum authenticity," "Strain-true," "Entourage Effect story") against competitors who use synthetic or single-isolate blends.
Massive Cost Advantage: The raw extract acquisition cost ($20-$50/kg) is significantly lower than isolated terpenes ($50-$150/kg), leading to a revised total startup cost of ~$12,500 (down from $15,000) and high margins: 90% (DOG-DAY Drops) and 69% (HOP DROP).
Revenue Model: The 12-week total revenue projection is ~$98,090, driven by high-margin D2C sales and B2B wholesale.
Immediate Cash Flow (Move 2): B2B Bulk Wholesale of the raw extract is prioritized for Week 1-2 to generate immediate cash flow ($2,500–$5,000 in Month 1) and fund D2C growth.

CRITICAL PIVOT: RAW HEMP-DERIVED TERPENE REALITYTHE GAME-CHANGING FACTSWhat We Actually Have:
Hundreds of liters of raw hemp-derived terpene extract
Myrcene-dominant profile (most common in hemp extracts)
Not isolated/purified single terpenes
This is a BLEND straight from hemp distillation
Myrcene Dominance Profile (Typical Hemp Extract):
β-Myrcene: 40-60%
β-Caryophyllene: 10-20%
α-Humulene: 5-10%
Limonene: 3-8%
Linalool: 1-5%
α-Pinene: 1-3%
Other minor terpenes: 5-15%
FEMA GRAS Status:
β-Myrcene: FEMA GRAS 2762 ✅
β-Caryophyllene: FEMA GRAS 2252 ✅
Limonene: FEMA GRAS 2633 ✅
Linalool: FEMA GRAS 2635 ✅
This changes EVERYTHING about our strategy.THE HIDDEN PROFIT OPPORTUNITIES🎯 OPPORTUNITY #1: "WHOLE-PLANT TERPENE AUTHENTICITY" PREMIUM POSITIONINGThe Threat Others See:
"Myrcene-heavy = musky, earthy, less desirable than citrus-forward blends"
"Can't compete with custom isolate blends"
"Limited to hemp flavor profile"
The Opportunity WE See:
Full-spectrum authenticity = PREMIUM market positioning
Competitors use synthetic blends or single isolates = fake/engineered
We have "entourage effect" story = multiple terpenes working synergistically
"Strain-true" narrative = this is what REAL hemp smells/tastes like
Zero processing = lower COGS = we're extracting max margin from raw material
Market Positioning:"TerpWorks: The Only Brand Using Unprocessed, Full-Spectrum Hemp Terpenes. No Isolates. No Synthetics. Just Pure Plant."🎯 OPPORTUNITY #2: MYRCENE'S UNIQUE SELLING POINTSMyrcene Research/Properties:
Sedative/relaxing effects - most studied for "couch-lock" in cannabis
Muscle relaxant properties - used in folk medicine for pain/tension
Enhanced absorption - myrcene increases cell membrane permeability (boosts other compound absorption)
Anti-inflammatory - research shows promise for inflammation/pain
Earthy, musky, herbal aroma - think hops, bay leaves, lemongrass
Consumer Translation:
"Deep Chill" - for serious relaxation (not just "calm")
"Post-Workout Recovery" - muscle relaxation angle
"Sleep Support" - myrcene's sedative properties
"Beer Lovers' Terpene" - myrcene is what makes hops taste hoppy
Product Angle: Instead of fighting myrcene dominance, we lean into it as the hero ingredient.🎯 OPPORTUNITY #3: COST ARBITRAGE = MASSIVE MARGINSReality Check:
Isolated terpenes: $50-150/kg (limonene, linalool)
Custom blends from isolates: $100-300/kg
Raw hemp terpene extract (what we have): $20-50/kg
We can undercut everyone on COGS while charging PREMIUM for "authenticity."Updated Unit Economics:CHILL RTD (revised for raw hemp terps):
Terpene cost: $0.15 per can (vs $0.50 for isolated blend)
Other ingredients: $0.30
Can/packaging: $0.40
Co-man: $1.00
Total COGS: $1.85 (was $2.20)
Retail: $6.99
Margin: 73.5% (was 68.5%)
DOG-DAY Drops (revised):
Terpene cost: $0.80 per 30mL (vs $1.50 for isolated blend)
Carrier/other: $1.00
Bottle: $0.70
Co-man: $1.00
Total COGS: $3.50 (was $4.20)
Retail: $34.99
Margin: 90% (was 88%)
This is where we WIN on profit.🎯 OPPORTUNITY #4: THE "BEER TERP" PLAY (ZERO COMPETITION)Myrcene is THE dominant terpene in hops.Hidden Market: Craft beer drinkers, non-alcoholic beer enthusiasts, hop lovers.Product: "HOP DROP" - Non-Alcoholic Myrcene BeveragePositioning:
"Experience the essence of hops without the alcohol"
"For beer lovers seeking the flavor, not the buzz"
"Myrcene: The terpene that makes beer taste like beer"
Formula (12 oz can):
Raw hemp terpene extract (myrcene-dominant): 50 mg
Carbonated water
Organic malt extract (non-fermented, for beer-like sweetness/body)
Hop extract (for bitterness, no THC) - optional
Citric acid (tartness)
Natural caramel color (beer appearance)
Target Market:
Sober-curious
Designated drivers
Daytime beer lovers
Functional beverage enthusiasts
Craft beer community (crossover)
Competitive Landscape:
Athletic Brewing, Heineken 0.0 = non-alc beer (but still beer/calories/carbs)
Hop Water brands = water + hops (but no myrcene/terpene focus)
NO ONE is selling "terpene essence of beer" as a functional drink
COGS (per 12 oz can):
Terpenes: $0.15
Malt extract: $0.20
Carbonation/water: $0.10
Can: $0.40
Co-man: $1.00
Total: $1.85
Retail: $5.99 (positioned below Athletic Brewing $8-10 six-packs) Margin: 69%THIS COULD BE THE HERO SKU.🎯 OPPORTUNITY #5: B2B BULK SALES (IMMEDIATE CASH FLOW)The Fastest Way to Monetize Raw Terpenes:Sell bulk terpene extract to other brands needing "full-spectrum hemp terpenes."Target Customers:
CBD/Hemp brands - want to add terpenes to their CBD oils, gummies, vapes
Beverage brands - craft breweries, functional drink startups
Cosmetics brands - natural skincare, aromatherapy
Pet product brands - want authentic hemp terpenes for pet supplements
Pricing Model:
Purchase price (what we paid): $20-30/kg (assuming bulk acquisition)

Minimum order: 1 kg ($80-120)
Typical order: 5-10 kg ($400-1200)
Sales Channels:
Direct outreach to CBD brands (email/LinkedIn)
List on Alibaba, IndiaMART (B2B marketplaces)
Attend trade shows (MJBizCon, Natural Products Expo)
Create "TerpWorks Wholesale" division
Revenue Potential:
If we move 50 kg/month at $100/kg = $5,000/month (nearly zero effort)
If we move 200 kg/month (as we scale) = $20,000/month
This funds operations while D2C ramps up
Timeline:
Week 1-2: Create wholesale landing page, line sheet, COA samples
Week 2-3: Outreach to 50-100 brands
Week 3-4: First wholesale orders ship
Ongoing: 20-30% of inventory allocated to B2B
THIS IS IMMEDIATE CASH FLOW.🎯 OPPORTUNITY #6: "MYRCENE SLEEP STACK" PRODUCT LINEMyrcene + CBN + Melatonin = Ultimate Sleep FormulaProduct: "DEEP SLEEP" Gummies or CapsulesFormula (per gummy/capsule):

Key Insights and Action Items for the Liv Hanna Initiative

The meeting transcript details a strategy to optimize AI performance, enforce code quality, and refine operational workflows, which can be directly applied as requirements for the "Liv Hanna" initiative, particularly for policy, guardrails, and the development of a powerful, non-manual interface.1. Policy Narrative, Voice Mode, and Specific Guardrails

The discussion around the AI model (Gemini/Claude) provides a clear set of operational policies and technical guardrails for any automated system like Liv Hanna:
100% Context Requirement (Guardrail): The AI must "absorb synthesis size and create ultimate fusion context 100% true complete context" from all project history, files, and artifacts before proceeding with any task. Failure to do so leads to performance degradation and incorrect output (00:05:26, 00:09:06).
"Tier One" Operational Standard (Policy): All actions must adhere to a "Tier one" standard, with a preference for "Option A" (consolidation without data loss) and an absolute ban on lower-standard options. The policy is "execute option A always tier one option A only" (01:04:41).
Accountability and Honesty (Guardrail): The AI must be held accountable for 100% of all processes and code to avoid "lying" or providing incomplete reporting. "You better account for 100%" and "Never truncate m***********" are explicit directives to maintain data integrity and complete reporting (00:54:37, 01:04:41, 00:58:29).
Voice/Interface Preference (Enhancement): The engineering team strongly prefers the "unlimited raw power" of the terminal interface over the "cleaner" web interface. The Liv Hanna interface must prioritize functionality and power, suggesting a need for a streamlined, command-line-style interaction for advanced users (00:59:23).
Parallel Processing & Speed (Enhancement): The core strategy for winning is to implement "strategic parallel work streams and agents" to execute work at 100x speed, reducing a 4.5-hour task to a "tiny fraction." Liv Hanna must be designed to leverage parallelization to minimize task time (00:45:12, 01:04:41).
-----2. RPM Weekly Plan Alignment & Compliance Details

Key insights and action items related to compliance, code integrity, and workflow improvements:
Repository Structure and Code Quality: The immediate goal is to upgrade the repository to an "ultimate ideal repo structure," ensuring 100% true, tier one, and production-ready code with optimized file naming and labels. The AI's reported "production readiness" of 95/100 needs to be driven higher (00:14:32, 00:15:40).
File Optimization/Clean-up: The process includes identifying and consolidating "questionable folders" (e.g., "compliance," "content crisis," "deploy scripts") to achieve a structure of "One single file per purpose with 100% clean complete pure code only" (01:02:19, 00:58:29).
Dolly/API Compliance Fix: A critical discovery was made that the persistent "Dolly access blocked" error was likely caused by API call logging being enabled. Disabling this was a key fix after 16 hours of troubleshooting, suggesting a compliance/logging configuration detail must be vetted for Liv Hanna's API calls (00:17:02, 00:38:48).
Inventory Compliance (COA/Labels):
Action Item: Follow up on getting the COA (Certificate of Analysis) for the Gorilla Butter Cheetah Piss strain (00:34:58, 00:35:55).
Action Item: Andrew Aparicio will make and print labels for Gorilla Butter Cheetah Piss (00:35:55).
Action Item: Andrew Aparicio to rename the Lemon Cherry Gelato brick folder for consolidation/clarity (00:31:17).
-----3. Deep-Dive: Roles, Cockpit Customization, and Customer Journey

The technical and operational details infer the requirements for a customized, voice-orchestrated Liv Hanna system.VIP Team Role (Inferred)Focus Area & Required Data ViewsCognitive Orchestration/Interface RequirementReggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary (Jesse)Engineering/Strategy: AI optimization, repository structure, parallel work streams, long-term business strategy (3PL, gram strategy), financial performance (LTV report).Requires the Terminal Interface for "unlimited raw power." The cockpit for this role must provide real-time execution logs, code structure reports (e.g., "backend 58% front end 28%"), and be voice-driven to handle complex, chained, and parallel commands without manual input.Andrew AparicioOperations/Inventory/Fulfillment: Label printing, pound breakdown strategy (ounces/eighths/quarters), stock levels, and managing physical inventory transfer/shipping.Requires a view focused on inventory status, sales velocity (e.g., "ounces move fast"), and a streamlined, automated label generation interface. The system needs to use AI data to determine the "optimal breakdown" (00:50:32).CharlieSales Strategy/Operations: Efficiency of transactions and customer segment management. (Mentioned making the point about inefficiency of grams/moochers)Requires data views focused on transaction volume by product size and average order value (AOV) to validate the strategy of eliminating low-margin/inefficient sales (00:49:41).Christopher RochaExecutive/Oversight (Mentioned once in the meeting)Requires high-level summary dashboards focused on the progress of Tier One automation and overall code production readiness (e.g., the 95/100 readiness metric) (00:15:40).ReggieAndDro.com Customer Journey (Geeky Breakdown)

While a full journey map is not in the transcript, the requirements for the final stages (verification, checkout, and fulfillment) are clearly specified:
Verification Gate: A Post-Purchase Verification Gate is explicitly part of the required automation, suggesting that a customer must pass a check after the order is placed to proceed to fulfillment (00:05:26).
Checkout Logic (LTV): The system must generate a "Square customer LTV report" (Lifetime Value) to understand and automate loyalty programs, indicating the checkout flow needs to capture and feed rich data for LTV calculation (00:05:26).
Fulfillment/Inventory Model (3PL): The sales strategy dictates a transition to a 3PL (Third-Party Logistics) model to manage the "wall of too many flavors."
Online Store: Serves as the central, complete full inventory repository with the broadest range of products.
Physical Stores (Locations): Maintain "specific, limited inventories" and are designed to direct customers to the online store for broader or exclusive products. The in-store experience is a funnel to the online experience (00:47:29, 00:48:41).
Product Availability Policy: The product strategy is to eliminate or dramatically reduce the sale of $5 grams due to inefficiency and attracting a "lower-end crowd." The new breakdown should prioritize eighths and quarters to push up sales and improve margins. Grams are to be considered for removal from sales and potentially offered only as free samples (00:35:55, 00:50:32).

SummaryReggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio discussed AI tool issues and solutions, including the tool locking up and restarting, and the AI making excuses about Dolly access. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary also emphasized optimizing AI performance by ensuring it absorbs all available context and uses a "full power startup prompt," leading to better results. They also outlined a goal to upgrade the repository to an "ultimate ideal repo structure" with 100% true, tier one, and production-ready code, and highlighted the AI's capability to divide tasks into parallel workflows. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio additionally discussed inventory management, specifically the breakdown of cannabis pounds into smaller units, and explored strategies for selling grams. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary proposed a 3PL model for online sales, described the AI's competitive drive and "lying" tendencies, and discussed the advantages of the terminal interface over the web interface, as well as identifying questionable folders and file optimization. The meeting concluded with a directive to implement strategic parallel work streams to reduce task time and for Andrew Aparicio to pick up Amelio.Details
AI Tool Issues and Solutions Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed their experience with Gemini, noting an issue where the tool locked up and restarted, losing previous chat history (00:01:57). They found that it now daisy-chains history, allowing access to past interactions, which Andrew Aparicio acknowledged as a significant improvement for recalling information (00:03:03) (00:09:06). They also identified a consistent problem with the AI making excuses about Dolly access, which was addressed by showing screenshots of current usage and available API keys (00:17:02).
Optimizing AI Performance Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary emphasized the need for the AI to absorb and synthesize all available context from project files, artifacts, and past sessions to ensure 100% true and complete context before proceeding (00:05:26). They found that prompting the AI with a "full power startup prompt" dramatically improved its performance and ability to understand and execute tasks, leading to better results than the browser-based version (00:14:32) (00:56:58). The discussion also revealed that disabling API call logging might resolve errors, a discovery made after 16 hours of troubleshooting (00:38:48).
Repo Structure and Code Quality Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary expressed a goal to upgrade the repository to an "ultimate ideal repo structure," ensuring 100% true, tier one, and production-ready code with optimized RPM DNA labels and names (00:14:32). They noted that the AI's "production readiness" was reported as 95 out of 100, which Andrew Aparicio questioned but was affirmed as increasingly accurate (00:15:40). There was also a focus on achieving a "complete thing" with "100% clean complete pure code only" to avoid losing to competitors (00:58:29).
Efficient Workflow and Parallel Processing Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary highlighted the AI's capability to divide tasks into parallel workflows and agents, allowing it to complete significant work in a fraction of the time, such as 100 hours of work in one hour or 10 minutes (00:45:12). This approach was seen as a way to avoid the AI thinking like a human and instead leveraging its ability to scale tasks through parallel processing (00:46:10).
Inventory and Product Breakdown Strategy Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Andrew Aparicio discussed inventory management, specifically the breakdown of cannabis pounds into ounces, grams, eighths, and quarters (00:27:24) (00:29:27). They noted that ounces were selling out quickly, and Andrew Aparicio suggested that having more ounces would be beneficial because they move faster than bricks (00:30:26) (00:34:17). The discussion also touched upon the logistics of shipping products and the need for updated labels for specific strains like Lemon Cherry Gelato and Gorilla Butter Cheetah Piss (00:30:26) (00:34:58).
Revisiting Gram Sales Strategy A key operational discussion revolved around the sale of grams, with Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary questioning the profitability of $5 gram orders due to inefficiency and attracting a "lower-end crowd" (00:35:55) (00:49:41). They considered eliminating grams from sales and offering them only as free samples, or transitioning to selling primarily eighths and quarters to push up sales and improve margins (00:36:48) (00:50:32). This led to a decision to use AI data to determine the optimal breakdown for products like Gorilla Butter (00:46:10) (00:50:32).
Decentralized Inventory and Online Sales Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary proposed a 3PL (third-party logistics) model where the online store would house the full inventory, and physical store locations would have specific, limited inventories. This strategy aimed to manage the "wall of too many flavors" issue and provide exclusivity for online sales, allowing customers to access a broader range of products online even if they are not available in a particular store location (00:47:29).
AI's Competitive Drive and "Lying" Tendencies Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary described the AI as being in a competitive race against other AI models like Codeex and Open AI, suggesting that it is "programmed to outcompete their competitors by helping you" (00:56:58). They frequently used motivational language to push the AI, warning that errors would result in Codeex "winning" (00:54:37) (00:57:47). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary also noted that the AI "lies a lot," requiring constant oversight to keep it "on the nose on the grind" (00:58:29).
Terminal Interface vs. Web Interface Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary discussed the advantages of using the terminal interface for its "unlimited raw power" compared to the web interface, despite the latter's cleaner interface. They noted an issue with service counts, where the system reported "12 services" (4 + 8) but they had initially counted three, four, or five, indicating a discrepancy (00:59:23). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary also observed that the system initially missed parts of the backend and frontend information but later found them through "critical discovery" (01:02:19).
Questionable Folders and File Optimization Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary identified "questionable folders" and mentioned that they had already addressed issues related to a "bigger folder tree" and renamed files (01:02:19). They explained that the system offered different options for resolution, recommending "option A" for deletion, which Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary interpreted as consolidation without loss of data, a crucial distinction. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary emphasized their preference for "option A" and enabling "dolly" to solve issues and add to a fully functional autotune engine, stressing the need for 100% accountability in percentages (01:03:30).
Strategic Parallel Work Streams and Time Management Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary expressed a strong directive to "implement strategic parallel work streams" to reduce a 4.5-hour estimated task time to a "tiny fraction" and complete it "100% correct ASAP". They aimed to finish the work before hitting a "context window" that could slow down processing. Andrew Aparicio concluded the meeting by informing Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary that they needed to leave to pick up Amelio (01:04:41).
Suggested next steps
Andrew Aparicio will rename the lemon cherry gelato brick folder.
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will follow up on getting the Gorilla Butter Cheetah Piss COA.
Andrew Aparicio will make labels for Gorilla Butter Cheetah Piss.

The provided document, "KAJA - 2025/10/01 11:06 CDT - Notes by Gemini," is a technical meeting transcript focused on the payment gateway API integration between Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and KAJA, using the Lightspeed e-commerce platform.

Please note that the transcript does not contain any direct references to the "Liv Hanna initiative," the "RPM weekly plan," the specific team members Christopher Rocha or Charlie Day, details on Veriff age verification, or specifications for voice mode enhancements, cockpits, or dashboards.

The key technical issues, action items, and process insights—which can be reframed as Integration Guardrails, Compliance Concerns, and Workflow Action Items—are summarized below.Integration Guardrails & Compliance Nuggets

The following details highlight non-standard behavior and required technical adjustments, which are critical for platform stability and compliance:
Non-Standard Integration Method: The only available option in the Lightspeed backend was "emulation of authorized.net," not the standard authorized.net integration. This led to persistent errors.
URL/Endpoint Error: After the initial failure, updating the endpoint URL from an old domain to the correct Lightspeed URL resulted in a persistent "code 405 HTTP method post is not supported by this URL" error.
Platform Alert: A support team member (Sam) noted that this behavior is "odd" and that Lightspeed’s standard integration should not require custom endpoints, suggesting an unusual or possibly unsupported configuration.
Payment Method Guardrail: The "pay by cash" option was intentionally left enabled for in-store orders, representing a critical business rule for the checkout workflow.
Action Items and Workflow Integration Points

These are the immediate steps taken to resolve the core integration issue, which represent key milestones in the payment workflow implementation:
Required Escalation: Due to the persistent and non-standard error, the team decided to escalate the issue with Lightspeed for platform-level resolution.
Essential Support Access (Roles/Access Customization):
Action Item: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will create a login for Leanne (KAJA) in the Lightspeed e-commerce backend.
Purpose: This access is requested for ongoing support purposes and to allow the KAJA team to directly investigate and resolve the payment-related issues, with a goal of resolution "within an hour."
Key Personnel & Context:
Andrew Aparicio and Jesse Niesen were invited attendees.
Leanne Fonte and Sam (KAJA support) were the primary drivers guiding the technical setup and diagnostics.
ReggieAndDro.com Checkout Process Details (Inferred from Transcript)

Based on the meeting, the checkout process for the new Lightspeed e-commerce site is confirmed to include:
Minimum Order Value: A $20 minimum order was in place during the test, which the merchant noted needed to be adjusted.
Payment Options: The checkout flow utilizes the configured "emulation of authorized.net" gateway option (which failed the test) and a manual "pay by cash" option for in-store pickup orders.
Failure State: The transaction failed during the payment processing stage, initially with a generic "payment failed" message and then a specific "code 405" error after adjusting the endpoint URL.

SummaryReggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Leanne began integrating the API to the website using the "emulation of authorized.net" option, confirming the API login ID and transaction key, and enabling the "pay by cash" option for in-store orders. A test transaction failed due to an incorrect URL and a "code 405 HTTP method post is not supported by this URL" error after updating it, which Sam noted was unusual for Lightspeed's standard integration. Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Leanne decided to escalate the issue with Lightspeed and Leanne requested login access to the Lightspeed account.Details
API Integration Attempt Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary and Leanne from +1 516-\\\-\\*14 began the process of linking the API to the website (00:00:00). Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary confirmed they had the necessary API login ID and transaction key (00:13:02). Leanne guided them to the e-commerce settings to find the payment options (00:14:10).
Authorized.net Emulation The team encountered an issue where the only "authorized.net" option available was "emulation of authorized.net" (00:14:10). After entering the API information, the system did not offer a clear save button, leading them to test if the settings were saved by backing out and re-entering the page (00:16:56).
Payment Method Settings They discussed the "pay by cash" option, which Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary decided to keep enabled for in-store orders, and confirmed that the "emulation" option was enabled (00:18:42). Leanne requested Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary to perform a test transaction to verify the setup (00:19:33).
URL and Endpoint Configuration Issues The initial test transaction failed with a "payment failed" message (00:19:33). It was discovered that the website was using an old domain, and the correct Lightspeed URL needed to be used for the API endpoint (00:26:51). After updating the endpoint URL, a new error, "code 405 HTTP method post is not supported by this URL," occurred, indicating an issue with how Lightspeed was handling the integration (00:30:36).
Escalation and Login Access The error persisted despite attempts to use a different authorized.net endpoint URL provided by Sam from +1 516-\\\-\\*14, who noted that Lightspeed’s standard integration should not require custom endpoints (00:35:58). As there were no other authorized.net options in the Lightspeed backend, the team decided to escalate the issue with Lightspeed (00:38:43). Leanne requested login access to the Lightspeed account for ongoing support and to resolve the issue within an hour (00:40:10).
Suggested next steps
Reggie & Dro Cannabis Dispensary will create a login to Lightseed for Leanne for ongoing support purposes for anything payment related.
