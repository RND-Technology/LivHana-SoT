- Lower infrastructure complexity

### Best For

## 🥉 OPTION 3: ZAPIER BRIDGE

**Speed**: 1 hour to deploy
**Cost**: $20-30/month (Zapier subscription)
**Real-time**: Mostly (occasional delays)

## 📊 WHAT YOUR SLACK MESSAGES REVEAL

### From the messages you shared, I extracted

**Sales Intelligence**:

- ✅ Back-to-back QP orders (momentum indicator)
- ⚠️ P&P costing $600/month (unsustainable)
- ⚠️ Website slowness (conversion impact)

**Operations Issues**:

- 🔴 Lightspeed sync broken (paid/delivered mismatch)
- 🔴 ShipStation/Shippo integration broken (Dylan manual work)
- 🟡 Inventory discrepancies (2 pre-rolls missing)

**Team Performance**:

- 🏆 Christopher: Management material (payroll execution, inventory)
- 🏆 Dylan: Diligent inventory tracking
- 🏆 Andrew: Issue escalation

**Strategic Intel**:

- 📊 Political intel (Patrick potentially sick)
- 📊 Process improvements needed (shipping automation)
- 📊 Supply chain coordination (Amazon supplies, ranch delivery)

**THIS SHOULD FLOW TO YOUR 3-AGENT FOUNDATION AUTOMATICALLY.**

## 🎼 35-MINUTE PLANNING SESSION

### What We Need to Decide

**1. Channel Selection** (5 min)

```
Which Slack channels to ingest?
Recommend:
✅ #operations
✅ #sales
✅ #team
⚠️ #general (may be noisy)
```

**2. Alert Thresholds** (10 min)

```
When to alert Jesse vs. silent tracking?
🔴 CRITICAL: Immediate alert
🟡 WARNING: Daily summary
🟢 INFO: Weekly summary
```

**3. Bot Behavior** (5 min)

```
Active (posts responses) or Silent (observes only)?
Recommend: ACTIVE
- Posts confirmations
- Asks clarifying questions
- Surfaces insights
```

**4. Privacy Boundaries** (5 min)

```
What to store vs. process-and-forget?
✅ STORE: Sales, ops, performance
❌ DON'T STORE: Personal health, complaints
```

**5. Integration Scope** (10 min)

```
Lightweight (alerts) or Full (dashboard)?
Recommend: Start LIGHTWEIGHT, scale to FULL
```
