## PLAYWRIGHT MCP CAPABILITIES

Once authenticated (after Claude Code restart), Playwright MCP can:

### Browser Automation

```javascript
// Navigate and interact
await page.goto('https://reggieanddro.com');
await page.click('button:has-text("Add to Cart")');

// Screenshot for UI grading
await page.screenshot({ path: 'checkout.png', fullPage: true });

// Extract data
const products = await page.locator('.product').allTextContents();

// Custom JavaScript execution
const buttonStyles = await page.evaluate(() => {
  const btn = document.querySelector('.category-button');
  return window.getComputedStyle(btn);
});
```

### AI-Powered Testing

- **Self-grading UIs**: AI evaluates screenshots against Christopher Standard
- **Auto-issue creation**: Failed tests → Linear issues automatically
- **Visual regression**: Compare screenshots before/after changes
- **Accessibility audit**: WCAG compliance checking

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Before Playwright**:

- ❌ Checkout bugs reached production ($911 blocker)
- ❌ No automated UI testing

- ✅ UI graded automatically (8/10 Christopher Standard)
- ✅ 100% test coverage on critical paths
- ✅ < 5 min feedback loop (PR → test results)
- ✅ Auto-create Linear issues on failures

---

## NEXT STEPS AFTER RESTART

1. **Restart Claude Code** to activate Playwright MCP
2. **Run first test**:

   ```bash
   cd tests/e2e
   npm install
   npx playwright install
   npm run test:reggiedro
   ```

3. **Review results** in HTML report
4. **Fix any failures** discovered
5. **Add to CI/CD** pipeline (GitHub Actions)

---

**CURRENT STATUS**:

- ✅ Playwright MCP configured
- ✅ E2E test suite created
- ✅ Config files ready
- ⏳ Authentication required (restart Claude Code)
- 📋 Ready for first test run

**NEXT PRIORITY**: Semgrep MCP installation (security scanning)
