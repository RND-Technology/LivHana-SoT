# üö® DNS INCIDENT REPORT - October 8, 2025

## CRITICAL ISSUE: DO-NOT-TOUCH DOMAIN DNS OVERWRITTEN

---

## üìã INCIDENT SUMMARY

**What Happened**: airbnbwaterfall.com DNS was changed from AWS to Google Cloud IPs
**Root Cause**: `.claude/update-dns-to-cloud-run.sh` script lacked DO-NOT-TOUCH guardrails
**Impact**: airbnbwaterfall.com pointed to wrong infrastructure (Google instead of AWS)
**Resolution Time**: ~15 minutes from detection to authoritative fix
**Status**: RESOLVED ‚úÖ

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (From Cheetah)

### The Script Problem
File: `.claude/update-dns-to-cloud-run.sh` (lines 22-90)

**Issue**: Script was targeting DO-NOT-TOUCH domains without exclusion logic:
- airbnbwaterfall.com
- reggieanddro.com
- tier1treecare.com

**Result**: Any execution of this script would overwrite protected domain A records with Cloud Run IPs (216.239.x.x)

### What Was Wrong

**airbnbwaterfall.com**:
- **Correct DNS** (AWS): 3.33.251.168, 15.197.225.128
- **Incorrect DNS** (was changed to Google Cloud): 216.239.32.21, 216.239.34.21, 216.239.36.21, 216.239.38.21
- **Status**: FIXED ‚úÖ

**reggieanddro.com**:
- **Correct DNS** (AWS): 52.20.90.245
- **Actual DNS**: 52.20.90.245 ‚úÖ
- **Status**: UNAFFECTED (remained correct)

**tier1treecare.com**:
- **Current DNS** (AWS): 3.33.130.190, 15.197.148.33
- **Status**: APPEARS CORRECT ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ö° RESOLUTION STEPS

### 1. Detection (2025-10-08T05:10Z)
- Jesse reported: "SOMEONE FUCKED UP THE DNS ON THE DO NOT TOUCH DOMAINS AGAIN"
- Immediate investigation launched

### 2. Diagnosis (2025-10-08T05:11Z)
- Checked all 8 protected domains
- Identified airbnbwaterfall.com showing Google Cloud IPs instead of AWS
- Verified other protected domains unaffected

### 3. Fix Applied (2025-10-08T05:12Z)
- Retrieved GoDaddy API credentials from 1Password
- Used GoDaddy API to revert airbnbwaterfall.com DNS:
```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.godaddy.com/v1/domains/airbnbwaterfall.com/records/A/%40" \
  -H "Authorization: sso-key [KEY]:[SECRET]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"data":"3.33.251.168","ttl":600},{"data":"15.197.225.128","ttl":600}]'
```
- HTTP 200 response confirmed success

### 4. Verification (2025-10-08T05:13Z)
- Checked authoritative nameserver (ns17.domaincontrol.com)
- Confirmed correct AWS IPs: 3.33.251.168, 15.197.225.128 ‚úÖ
- Verified AWS load balancer responding (awselb/2.0) ‚úÖ
- DNS propagation: 10 minutes (TTL=600)

## üìä PROTECTED DOMAINS FINAL STATUS

### ‚úÖ FIXED
1. **airbnbwaterfall.com**: Reverted to AWS (3.33.251.168, 15.197.225.128)

### ‚úÖ UNAFFECTED (Never Changed)
2. **reggieanddro.com**: Still on AWS (52.20.90.245)
3. **tier1treecare.com**: Still on AWS (3.33.130.190, 15.197.148.33)
4. **reggieanddroalice.com**: Still on original (148.72.126.250)
5. **reggieanddrodispensary.com**: Still on original (148.72.126.250)
6. **hempress3.com**: Still on original (199.34.228.177)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SUBDOMAINS (No DNS Records)
- brain.reggieanddro.com (no records)
- shop.reggieanddro.com (no records)
- voice.reggieanddro.com (no records)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTIVE MEASURES (Implemented by Cheetah)

### Script Fix
File: `.claude/update-dns-to-cloud-run.sh` (lines 18-88)

**New Guardrails**:
```bash
DO_NOT_TOUCH=(
  "airbnbwaterfall.com"
  "reggieanddro.com"
  "tier1treecare.com"
  "reggieanddroalice.com"
  "reggieanddrodispensary.com"
  "hempress3.com"
)

# Check before updating
if [[ " ${DO_NOT_TOUCH[@]} " =~ " ${domain} " ]]; then
  echo "‚õî SKIPPING $domain (DO NOT TOUCH)"
  continue
fi
```

### Accountability
- Logged as **Error #5** in `TEAM_ACCOUNTABILITY_SYSTEM.md:65-86`
- Responsibility: Claude Code (script author)
- New Guarantee: All DNS tools must honor DO-NOT-TOUCH list

### Daily Checks
- DNS integrity check added to daily enforcement (TEAM_ACCOUNTABILITY_SYSTEM.md:106-110)
- System-of-thought index updated (MACHINE_PROPOSALS_INDEX.md:74-79)
- All agents must confirm exclusions before DNS operations

---

## üéØ LESSONS LEARNED

### What Went Wrong
1. DNS automation script lacked exclusion logic
2. DO-NOT-TOUCH list not programmatically enforced
3. Script could run without verifying domain protection status

### What Went Right
1. Rapid detection (Jesse caught it immediately)
2. Fast diagnosis (<2 minutes to identify issue)
3. Quick fix (authoritative records corrected in <5 minutes)
4. Cheetah had already identified root cause and implemented guardrails
5. Only 1 domain affected (could have been worse)

### Improvements Needed
1. ‚úÖ Add DO-NOT-TOUCH guardrails to all DNS scripts (DONE by Cheetah)
2. ‚úÖ Log accountability for script authorship (DONE)
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è Run validation script before declaring "all fixed"
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Test DNS automation in staging before production
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è Add pre-execution checks to all deployment scripts
