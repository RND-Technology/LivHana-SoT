## Part 1: Claude Code Setup & Autonomous Coding Framework

### Installation on M4 Max

**Prerequisites:**
1. Node.js v20 or higher (check with `node --version`)
2. Install if needed: `brew install node` or download from nodejs.org
3. Claude Team or Enterprise subscription with API access

**Installation Steps:**
```bash
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Authenticate with your Claude account
claude-code auth
# This opens browser for login and stores auth token locally

# Verify installation
claude-code --version
```

**Initial Configuration:**
Claude Code uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to access different capabilities. Configuration lives in `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`

### MCP Server Configuration for Maximum Power

**Filesystem Access (Core Capability):**
Run Claude Code from your project root directory for automatic filesystem access. For multi-repo setup across R&D, HNC, OPS, and HERB:

Option A: Run separate sessions in each repo directory  
Option B: Create parent directory containing all repos and run from there for cross-project architecture work

**Additional MCP Servers to Configure:**
- **Database MCP:** For PostgreSQL/MySQL schema inspection, queries, migrations
- **API Integration MCP:** For authenticated access to Square, Lightspeed, Veriff APIs
- **Cloud Platform MCP:** For GCP or AWS deployment automation
- **Custom MCP:** Build your own for proprietary system integration

**Context Window Optimization:**
Tune context settings based on project size:
- Large monorepo: Maximum context to see entire architecture
- Multiple smaller projects: Aggressive context management for efficiency

### Prompt Engineering Framework for Autonomous Tasks

**Five-Component Prompt Structure:**

#### 1. Objective and Scope
Define exactly what you want built/fixed and boundaries.

**Example:**
"Implement complete JWT-based authentication system for Reggie & Dro customer portal, covering registration, login, password reset, and session management. Scope includes backend API endpoints, database schema, and frontend integration points but excludes UI components which will be handled separately."

#### 2. Technical Constraints and Architecture
Specify frameworks, libraries, patterns to use and avoid.

**Example:**
"Use Express.js for API layer, PostgreSQL for user storage, bcrypt for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for JWT generation. Follow RESTful patterns. Do not use Passport or Auth0 - build from first principles. All endpoints must include rate limiting and CORS configuration. Migrations use node-pg-migrate."

#### 3. Security and Compliance Requirements
Critical for cannabis business regulatory compliance.

**Example:**
"All passwords use bcrypt cost factor 12. JWTs include user role claims for RBAC. Tokens expire after 24 hours with refresh rotation. All auth endpoints log to separate audit table. Password reset tokens single-use, expire after 1 hour. Rate limiting blocks brute force with exponential backoff."

#### 4. Testing and Validation
Define verification before considering complete.

**Example:**
"Write comprehensive Jest unit tests covering success, failure, edge cases, and security scenarios. Create integration tests verifying complete flow from registration through token refresh. Write API endpoint tests verifying HTTP codes, error messages, response formats. Include load test configuration for 1000 concurrent requests. All tests must pass."

#### 5. Documentation and Handoff
Artifacts needed beyond code.

**Example:**
"Provide developer README explaining architecture, documenting all endpoints with request/response examples, including setup instructions. Create database migration with rollback. Generate OpenAPI specification. Include security considerations document explaining threat model and mitigations."

### Advanced Error Minimization Techniques

#### 1. Explicit Error Handling Specification
Don't just say "add payment processing" - specify every failure mode.

**Example:**
"Add payment processing with explicit error handling for network timeouts, invalid card numbers, insufficient funds, duplicate transaction attempts, and payment gateway downtime. Each error type returns specific error code and user-friendly message. All payment errors logged with transaction ID. Network failures trigger automatic retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts."

#### 2. Success Criteria with Automated Verification
Define measurable outcomes and require automated tests.

**Example:**
"Build user dashboard that loads in under 2 seconds with 100 concurrent users, displays all user data with zero data loss, handles missing data gracefully, passes WCAG accessibility standards. Write automated tests verifying each criterion and fail if any criterion not met."

#### 3. Staged Implementation with Checkpoints
Break large features into stages with validation at each stage.

**Example:**
"Implement authentication in three stages. Stage 1: database schema and migrations with tests verifying integrity. Stage 2: API endpoints with unit tests. Stage 3: frontend integration with end-to-end tests. At each stage, run all tests and verify no existing functionality broke before proceeding."

#### 4. Defensive Programming Requirements
Explicitly require input validation, edge case handling, failure planning.

**Example:**
"All API endpoints validate input parameters and return 400 errors with specific validation messages. All database queries handle connection failures and timeouts. All external API calls include circuit breakers preventing cascading failures. All user inputs sanitized against injection attacks."

#### 5. Code Review Simulation
Ask Claude to review its own code before considering complete.

**Example:**
"After implementing, conduct self-code review checking for: code style consistency, proper error handling in all paths, security vulnerabilities in input handling, performance bottlenecks in queries, missing edge case handling, inadequate test coverage, unclear or missing documentation. Fix issues found before marking complete."

### Realistic Workflow and Quality Expectations

**Autonomous Task Execution Flow:**
1. Read relevant codebase to understand existing architecture
2. Plan implementation, breaking into logical steps
3. Write code following specified constraints and patterns
4. Write tests verifying code works correctly
5. Run tests and fix failures
6. Review own work for issues
7. Generate requested documentation

**Quality Dependencies:**
- Vague prompt = vague results
- Detailed prompt following templates = production-ready code
- Quality depends on communication clarity, not AI capability alone

**Error Rate Reality:**
Autonomous work has higher error rates than supervised (like in Cursor) because no real-time course correction. Tradeoff for autonomy. Minimize errors through:
- Explicit requirements
- Good pattern examples
- Comprehensive testing requirements
- Automated verification

**Biggest Risk: Architectural Misalignment**
Solution: Be explicit about patterns, libraries, future integration needs, performance characteristics, broader architecture, long-term plans.

**Recommended Workflow:**
1. Start with smaller, well-defined tasks to build confidence
2. Gradually delegate larger, more complex systems
3. Use two-phase approach for critical systems:
   - Phase 1: Design and document architecture (no code yet)
   - Phase 2: Implement approved design with constraint to follow exactly

**Multi-Layer Task Management:**
For R&D, HNC, OPS, and HERB layers:
- Start small with low-risk tasks (e.g., "implement email notification system for HNC subscriber updates")
- Build confidence with quality and documentation
- Graduate to critical systems (Square payment integration, THCa compliance reporting)

## Part 2: Tonight's Lightspeed Conversion Optimization

### Critical Political Intelligence

**Lt Gov Timothy Update (September 30, 2025):**
Dan Patrick's anti-THC crusade becoming political liability with Texas education system. Top educators frustrated with his behavior, viewing THC stance as his "Achilles heel." Strategic opportunity to position Reggie & Dro as freedom/prosperity alternative to failed prohibition.

**Messaging Framework:**
- Texas farmers should grow and sell legal crops without government interference
- Texas businesses should serve legal products to adults without nanny-state restrictions
- Texas economic freedom includes hemp industry creating jobs and tax revenue
- This is pro-freedom, pro-prosperity, pro-Texas (not pro-drug)

**Timing:** Online launch aligns perfectly with Patrick's doubling down - you're showing what Texas prosperity looks like when freedom wins.

---

### Homepage Hero Section Optimization

**Three Things to Communicate in First 5 Seconds:**
1. What you sell
2. Why Texas customers should trust you
3. What action to take

**Recommended Headline:**
"Texas-Grown Hemp. Texas-Tested Quality. Texas-Sized Freedom."

Hits: Local pride + Quality assurance + Liberty frame for conservative audience

**Hero Visual Requirements:**
- Actual Texas facilities (not stock photos)
- Real products with visible COA certifications
- Texas imagery reinforcing local trust
- Avoid generic cannabis imagery - want "Texas neighbor who takes this seriously"

**Primary CTA:**
"Shop Texas Hemp" or "Browse Premium THCa"  
(Better than generic "Shop Now" - tells customers exactly what they're getting)

**Secondary CTA:**
"Learn About THCa"  
(For education-first customers needing confidence before buying)

---

### Trust Signals (Conversion Rate Critical)

**Trust Bar Below Hero Section:**
- Texas compliance badge
- Third-party lab testing logos
- Customer review count with star rating
- Guarantee statement

**Example Trust Statement:**
"100% Legal Texas Hemp | Lab-Tested Every Batch | 30-Day Satisfaction Guarantee | 10,000+ Happy Texas Customers"

**Why This Matters:**
For regulated products in skeptical markets, trust kills more conversions than price. Customers need to know: legal, safe, tested, backed by real people.

**Credential Display:**
- Licenses and certifications prominently shown
- Customer testimonials with real names and Texas cities (specificity builds credibility)

---

### Product Page Conversion Formula

**Essential Elements:**
1. Compelling product photos from multiple angles
2. Clear pricing with volume discounts visible
3. Detailed description speaking benefits not just features
4. Prominent COA link or embed
5. Customer reviews with social proof
6. Related products for cross-sell
7. Frictionless add-to-cart flow

**Product Description Framework:**
Address unspoken Texas customer questions:

**"Is this legal?"**  
Yes - explain 0.3% delta-9 THC compliance clearly

**"Will I feel high?"**  
Explain THCa effects honestly and accurately

**"How is this tested?"**  
Link to that specific batch's COA

**"What do other Texans think?"**  
Social proof from reviews with Texas locations

**Product Photography Standards:**
- Show actual product clearly
- Texas branding visible
- Packaging communicates quality
- Premium photos = premium prices, Generic photos = price competition

---

### Cart and Checkout Optimization

**Abandoned Cart Root Causes:**
1. Unexpected shipping costs appearing late
2. Complicated checkout with too many form fields
3. Lack of guest checkout option
4. Payment security concerns
5. No urgency mechanism

**Tonight's Fixes:**
- Show shipping costs earlier (or offer free shipping threshold)
- Minimize form fields to absolute essentials
- Make guest checkout default with optional account creation after purchase
- Display security badges near payment entry
- Add soft urgency: "X people viewing" or "Limited batch availability"

**Checkout Flow Best Practices:**
- Single-page checkout ideal, maximum two pages
- Progress indicator showing exactly where in process
- Final CTA button: "Complete Secure Order" (not generic "Submit")
- Every additional click = conversion opportunity lost

---

### Mobile Experience Priority

**Why Mobile Matters:**
Likely 60-70% of your traffic

**Tonight's Mobile Test:**
1. Pull up reggieanddro.company.site on your phone
2. Complete full test purchase
3. Time the process
4. Note every frustration point
5. Identify where you'd abandon as real customer

**Common Mobile Conversion Killers:**
- Buttons too small to tap easily
- Images don't scale properly
- Forms trigger wrong keyboards
- Checkout requires excessive zooming and scrolling

**Mobile Optimization Standards:**
- Site loads in under 3 seconds
- All text readable without zooming
- All buttons thumb-friendly
- Entire purchase flow feels native-app smooth

**Priority Decision:**
If choosing between desktop and mobile optimization, fix mobile first - that's where most traffic lives.

---

### Email Capture Strategy

**Current Problem:**
Only capturing emails at checkout = missing everyone who browses but doesn't buy

**Strategic Email Capture Points:**
1. Exit-intent popup offering first-purchase discount
2. Content upgrade: "Free THCa Guide for Texas Buyers" for email
3. Quiz or product finder delivering results via email
4. Prominent newsletter signup with clear value proposition

**Value Exchange Framework:**
❌ Weak: "Join our newsletter"  
✅ Strong: "Get 15% off your first order plus Texas hemp education delivered weekly"

**Principle:**
People give email when they believe they're getting something worthwhile in return.

## Closing Notes

This playbook represents the complete strategic framework for Reggie & Dro's transformation from traditional retail to optimized e-commerce leader, powered by autonomous AI development through Claude Code and comprehensive conversion optimization.

The research process is currently running to gather additional intelligence from your Gmail and repositories, which will enhance the Lightspeed integration guidance, email sequence specifics, and Dream 100 target identification.

**Your mission is clear:** Deschedule Cannabis sativa L entirely, abolish the hemp/marijuana split, and make Texas the global model of freedom, safety, and prosperity. This playbook is your operational blueprint for achieving that vision through commerce, technology, and strategic positioning.

**Rally cries remain:**
- "Grow baby grow and sell baby sell"
- "Grow, Sell, Heal"

**The tight squeeze you mentioned isn't a problem - it's your competitive advantage.** While others wait for perfect conditions, you're shipping, optimizing, and scaling simultaneously. That's unicorn-maker velocity.

Execute tonight's priorities. Let Claude Code handle the backend restructuring. Trust the autonomous systems you've deployed. And tomorrow, you'll wake up with a hardened codebase, an optimized conversion funnel, and momentum that compounds daily.

Texas takeover isn't coming - it's happening right now.
