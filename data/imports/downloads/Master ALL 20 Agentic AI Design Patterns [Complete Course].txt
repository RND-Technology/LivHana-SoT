	What you’ll get: TL;DRs, visuals, free resources
		The video will provide summaries (TL;DRs) for each of the 20 patterns.
		Visual aids and workflow diagrams clarify each pattern in plain English.
		The approach is practical, focusing on real workflows rather than abstract text.
		The presenter shares a repository containing all patterns and diagrams for hands-on learning.
	Pattern 1: Prompt Chaining (assembly-line steps & validations)
		Prompt chaining breaks a large task into sequential smaller steps executed one after another.
		Each step validates the output of the previous step before passing data forward, akin to an assembly line ensuring quality at every station.
		This modular approach allows error catching early and retries to pass validation.
		Common use cases include complex multi-step processes like data cleaning, document processing, content creation, and code generation.
		Pros: Modular and flexible; cons: context explosion (large data tokens accumulate across steps), error propagation, and slower performance due to multiple inference points.
		Example: Labeling and cleaning poorly structured data stepwise using generative and non-generative AI.
	Pattern 2: Routing (smart triage to specialist agents)
		Routing directs incoming requests to the appropriate specialist agent based on intent and context.
		It functions like a smart receptionist that asks clarifying questions when uncertain before forwarding requests.
		The system assigns requests to agents such as tech support, sales, or accounting.
		Pros: Specialization, scalability, and efficiency; cons: potential misrouting, edge cases, and the need for confidence thresholds.
		Applications include customer service, enterprise automations, and healthcare triage with voice agents handling initial calls.
	Pattern 3: Parallelization (split, normalize, merge)
		Parallelization splits large jobs into independent chunks processed simultaneously by multiple worker agents.
		Each worker handles a subtask independently; results are normalized (standardized) and merged into a cohesive output.
		Useful for large-scale data handling, web scraping, document processing, research automation, and testing frameworks.
		Pros: Specialization and scalability without capital funding; cons: increased complexity needing coordination and difficulty normalizing outputs.
		Example: Reducing customer churn by parallelizing exit interviews, surveys, and data analyses.
	Pattern 4: Reflection (critic → revise → pass)
		Reflection involves generating a first draft, having a critic agent review it against quality rubrics, and iteratively revising until quality standards are met.
		The process includes unit tests like grammar and logic checks.
		A max attempt limit prevents infinite loops, similar to academic essay resubmissions.
		Primarily used in content generation, legal writing, academic writing, and product descriptions.
		Pros: Strong focus on quality; cons: high API costs and potential throttling issues due to repeated requests.
	Pattern 5: Tool Use (discover, authorize, execute, fallback)
		Tool use allows AI to discover available external tools, verify permissions, and execute appropriate tools to fulfill tasks.
		The workflow includes safety checks, tool call preparations, execution, parsing outputs, and fallback mechanisms.
		Applications span research assistance, data analysis, customer service, and content management.
		Pros: Improves quality and reduces errors; cons: risk of propagating mistakes if a tool misuse goes unnoticed.
		Example tools: web search APIs, databases, calculators, file systems.
	Pattern 6: Planning (milestones, dependencies, constraints)
		Planning decomposes a big goal into milestones and dependencies, factoring in constraints like budget, deadlines, and data availability.
		Generates a step-by-step plan assigning agents and tools to each milestone and tracks progress against acceptance criteria.
		Useful in project management, software development, and research projects.
		Pros: Strategic execution and adaptability to changing environments; cons: complexity in setup and coordination.
		Analogy: Planning a road trip with checkpoints and traffic monitoring.
	Pattern 7: Multi-Agent Collaboration (manager + roles + shared memory)
		Multiple specialized agents collaborate on different task parts, coordinated by a central manager or orchestrator.
		Agents share a common memory store structured to avoid overlap and ensure relevant data persistence.
		The orchestration resembles a film crew with a director and specialists communicating via a shared script.
		Roles include a coordinator assigning tasks and agents validating acceptance criteria for each task before proceeding.
		Applications: iterative refinement, software/product development, financial analysis, content creation, research.
		Pros: Specialization and parallel processing; cons: requires extensive setup and continuous testing.
	Pattern 8: Memory Management (short/episodic/long-term, retrieval)
		Classifies information as short-term (session-limited), episodic, or long-term knowledge, storing each with metadata on recency and relevance.
		Manages memory compression when context windows are full and indexes memories for efficient retrieval.
		Supports conversational continuity across sessions, enabling personalized interactions in customer service, personal assistance, and education.
		Pros: Preserves context over time; cons: privacy concerns, memory bloat, and determining when to flush old memories.
	Pattern 9: Learning & Adaptation (feedback → prompts/policies/tests)
		Collects user feedback, corrections, and quality ratings to clean and validate data, removing noise and malicious inputs.
		Updates prompts, policies, multi-shot examples, or fine-tunes models based on validated feedback.
