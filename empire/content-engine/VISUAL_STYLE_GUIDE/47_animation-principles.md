### Animation Principles

**Applied from Traditional Animation:**

1. **Squash and Stretch** (Limited use)
   - Subtle only (professional, not cartoonish)
   - Used for emphasis or comic relief (Chief Steve)
   - Maintains volume

2. **Anticipation**
   - Brief wind-up before action
   - Draws attention to upcoming motion
   - Makes action more dynamic

3. **Staging**
   - Clear presentation of idea
   - One action at a time for clarity
   - Guided viewer attention

4. **Follow Through**
   - Hair, clothing continue after body stops
   - Gives weight and realism
   - Subtle overlapping action

5. **Ease In/Ease Out**
   - Natural acceleration/deceleration
   - Applied to most movements
   - Professional smooth motion

6. **Arcs**
   - Natural curved motion paths
   - No robotic straight-line movement
   - Applies to gestures, turns, movements

7. **Secondary Action**
   - Supporting gestures enhance main action
   - Doesn't distract from primary
   - Adds richness and personality
