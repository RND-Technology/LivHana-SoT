### Background Design Principles

**Hierarchy Rules:**

1. **Character First:** Background supports, doesn't compete
2. **Clarity:** Background provides context but doesn't distract
3. **Contrast:** Sufficient contrast between character and background
4. **Simplification:** Reduce detail for mobile viewing
5. **Style Consistency:** Match overall HNC aesthetic

**Detail Levels:**

- **Foreground (Characters):** High detail, clear features
- **Midground (Environment):** Moderate detail, clear shapes
- **Background (Depth):** Low detail, simplified shapes, muted colors

**Texture Usage:**

- Minimal texture (flat color preferred)
- Subtle grain for Texas landscapes (desert feel)
- No busy patterns or distracting textures
- Clean, professional finish
