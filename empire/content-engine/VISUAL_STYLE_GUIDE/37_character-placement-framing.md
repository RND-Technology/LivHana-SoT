### Character Placement & Framing

**9:16 Vertical Format Considerations:**

**Single Character (Talking Head):**
- Position: Upper 2/3 of frame
- Head Space: 10% gap above head
- Eye Line: Approximately 1/3 down from top
- Background: Lower 1/3 for text/graphics

**Two Characters (Dialogue):**
- Split frame or alternating shots
- Over-the-shoulder angles for conversation
- Clear speaker identification
- Maintain eye-line consistency

**Character + Environment:**
- Character: Upper or middle frame
- Environment: Context below or behind
- Text Space: Bottom 20% reserved
- Clear focal hierarchy

**Group Scene:**
- Vertical stacking if needed
- Foreground/background depth
- Clear character distinction
- Avoid crowding
