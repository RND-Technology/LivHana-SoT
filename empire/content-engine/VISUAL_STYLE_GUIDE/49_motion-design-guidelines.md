### Motion Design Guidelines

**Camera Movement:**

- **Pan:** Slow horizontal movement to follow subject or reveal space
- **Tilt:** Vertical camera movement (use sparingly)
- **Zoom:** Push in for emphasis, pull out for context
- **Shake:** Brief intense shake for impact (0.2 seconds max)

**Speed Guidelines:**

- **Slow:** 2-3 seconds for establishing shots, emotional moments
- **Medium:** 0.5-1 second for standard actions, transitions
- **Fast:** 0.2-0.4 seconds for emphasis, quick reactions, cuts

**Motion Easing Chart:**

```
Ease Out (Decelerating)
Usage: Entrances, reveals, attention-grabbing
Curve: Fast start → Slow end
━━━━━━╲___________

Ease In (Accelerating)
Usage: Exits, disappearing elements
Curve: Slow start → Fast end
___________╱━━━━━━

Ease In-Out (S-Curve)
Usage: Movement within frame, smooth transitions
Curve: Slow → Fast → Slow
_______╱━━╲_______

Linear (Constant Speed)
Usage: Technical elements, data, mechanical
Curve: Constant speed throughout
