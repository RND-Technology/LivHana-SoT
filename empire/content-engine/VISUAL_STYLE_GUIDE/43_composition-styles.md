### Composition Styles

**1. CENTERED PORTRAIT (Primary)**
- Character centered, facing camera
- Head/shoulders in upper 60% of frame
- Text space in lower 40%
- Most common for dialogue scenes

**2. RULE OF THIRDS**
- Character positioned 1/3 from left or right
- Remaining 2/3 for context or secondary elements
- Creates dynamic asymmetry
- Good for presenting to something (product, data)

**3. VERTICAL STACKING**
- Multiple elements stacked vertically
- Character → Product → Text (top to bottom)
- Clear hierarchy through positioning
- Efficient use of vertical space

**4. SPLIT FRAME**
- Two characters in same frame (side by side or vertical)
- Dialogue scenes between two characters
- Before/after comparisons
- Contrasting perspectives

**5. ENVIRONMENT CONTEXT**
- Character in lower 50%, environment in upper 50%
- Establishes location and context
- Used for scene-setting shots
- Transitions between locations
