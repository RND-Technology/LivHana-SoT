### Style Evolution

While this guide establishes the foundational visual style for HIGH NOON CARTOON, we recognize that:
- **Consistency is key** for the first 84 episodes (maintain brand recognition)
- **Quality improves** as production workflows optimize
- **Audience feedback** will inform future iterations
- **Platform trends** will influence tactical adaptations
- **Long-term vision** allows for style evolution in Season 2+
