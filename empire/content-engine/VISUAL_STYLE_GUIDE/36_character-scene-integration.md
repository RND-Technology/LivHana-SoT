### Character-Scene Integration

**Lighting Harmony:**
- Match character lighting to scene environment
- Maintain consistent light direction across scene
- Use rim lighting to separate character from background
- Avoid characters appearing "pasted on" background

**Scale Consistency:**
- Maintain relative character heights in group scenes
- Ensure characters fit naturally in environments
- Appropriate size for scene depth (foreground vs background)

**Color Harmony:**
- Character colors complement scene colors
- No clashing color combinations
- Use character-specific palettes consistently
- Background colors don't overpower character
