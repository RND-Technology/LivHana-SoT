### Movement Philosophy

**"Purposeful Motion"** - Every movement should serve the story, clarify information, or enhance engagement. No motion for motion's sake.

**Core Principles:**

1. **Clarity over Complexity:** Simple, clear movements
2. **Personality through Motion:** Character-appropriate animation
3. **Mobile-Friendly:** Not too fast (visible on small screens)
4. **Smooth Transitions:** Professional quality, no jarring cuts
5. **Purposeful Emphasis:** Motion draws attention to key elements
