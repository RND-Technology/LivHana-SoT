### Color Usage Rules

**DO:**

- Use warm Texas tones for protagonist scenes (Jesse, Liv Hana with Jesse)
- Use cool tones for tech/data (Liv Hana solo, data displays)
- Use official neutrals for Chief Steve (bureaucratic feel)
- Use military greens for Lt. Dan (discipline, compliance)
- Use dark/cold tones for Aubrey (villain aesthetic)
- Maintain high contrast between character and background
- Test colors for mobile visibility

**DON'T:**

- Mix too many colors in one scene (max 3-4 primary colors)
- Use neon or overly saturated colors (unprofessional)
- Use pure black backgrounds (too harsh, use dark charcoal #2C2C2C)
- Use pure white backgrounds (too bright, use off-white #F5F5F5)
- Forget accessibility (maintain contrast ratios)
