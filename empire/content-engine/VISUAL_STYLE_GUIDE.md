## ANIMATION STYLE PRINCIPLES

### Movement Philosophy

**"Purposeful Motion"** - Every movement should serve the story, clarify information, or enhance engagement. No motion for motion's sake.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Clarity over Complexity:** Simple, clear movements
2. **Personality through Motion:** Character-appropriate animation
3. **Mobile-Friendly:** Not too fast (visible on small screens)
4. **Smooth Transitions:** Professional quality, no jarring cuts
5. **Purposeful Emphasis:** Motion draws attention to key elements

### Animation Timing

**Frame Rate:** 30 FPS (standard for social media)

**Timing Standards:**
- **Quick Actions:** 0.2-0.3 seconds (button presses, small gestures)
- **Normal Actions:** 0.5-0.8 seconds (walking, turning, standard movements)
- **Dramatic Actions:** 1.0-1.5 seconds (reveals, important moments)
- **Transitions:** 0.3-0.5 seconds (scene changes, cuts)
- **Text Animations:** 0.3 seconds (fade in/out)

**Easing:**
- **Ease Out:** For entrances (objects/characters entering frame)
- **Ease In:** For exits (objects/characters leaving frame)
- **Ease In-Out:** For movement within frame (smooth, natural)
- **Linear:** For mechanical/tech elements, data displays

### Character Animation (D-ID Integration)

**D-ID Best Practices:**
- Use D-ID for facial animation (talking, expressions)

## COMPOSITION & LAYOUT

### Vertical Video Composition (9:16)

**Frame Zones (Top to Bottom):**

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   TOP 10% - PLATFORM UI │ ← Avoid important content
├─────────────────────────┤
│   SAFE ZONE - TITLES    │ ← Episode titles, scene headings
├─────────────────────────┤
│                         │
│   MAIN CHARACTER ZONE   │ ← Primary character placement
│   (Face, upper body)    │    Eyes at ~1/3 from top
│                         │
├─────────────────────────┤
│   SECONDARY CONTENT     │ ← Supporting visuals, data
├─────────────────────────┤
│   TEXT/GRAPHICS ZONE    │ ← Dialogue, captions, info
├─────────────────────────┤
│   BOTTOM 15% - CTA/UI   │ ← Hashtags, CTAs, platform UI
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Composition Styles

**1. CENTERED PORTRAIT (Primary)**
- Character centered, facing camera
- Head/shoulders in upper 60% of frame
- Text space in lower 40%
- Most common for dialogue scenes

**2. RULE OF THIRDS**
- Character positioned 1/3 from left or right
- Remaining 2/3 for context or secondary elements
- Creates dynamic asymmetry
- Good for presenting to something (product, data)

**3. VERTICAL STACKING**
- Multiple elements stacked vertically
- Character → Product → Text (top to bottom)
- Clear hierarchy through positioning
- Efficient use of vertical space

**4. SPLIT FRAME**
- Two characters in same frame (side by side or vertical)
- Dialogue scenes between two characters
- Before/after comparisons
- Contrasting perspectives

**5. ENVIRONMENT CONTEXT**
- Character in lower 50%, environment in upper 50%
- Establishes location and context
- Used for scene-setting shots
- Transitions between locations

### Visual Hierarchy

**Priority Order:**
1. **Character Faces** (highest priority - emotion, connection)
2. **Text/Dialogue** (second - information delivery)
3. **Products/Props** (third - supporting elements)
4. **Environment** (fourth - context)
5. **Graphics/Effects** (fifth - enhancement)

**Techniques for Hierarchy:**
- **Size:** Larger = more important
- **Contrast:** Higher contrast = more attention
- **Color:** Saturated/bright = focal point
- **Position:** Center/upper frame = primary focus
- **Motion:** Movement attracts eye
- **Depth:** Foreground = more important

### Layout Templates

## MOTION & TRANSITIONS

### Animation Principles

**Applied from Traditional Animation:**

1. **Squash and Stretch** (Limited use)
   - Subtle only (professional, not cartoonish)
   - Used for emphasis or comic relief (Chief Steve)
   - Maintains volume

2. **Anticipation**
   - Brief wind-up before action
   - Draws attention to upcoming motion
   - Makes action more dynamic

3. **Staging**
   - Clear presentation of idea
   - One action at a time for clarity
   - Guided viewer attention

4. **Follow Through**
   - Hair, clothing continue after body stops
   - Gives weight and realism
   - Subtle overlapping action

5. **Ease In/Ease Out**
   - Natural acceleration/deceleration
   - Applied to most movements
   - Professional smooth motion

6. **Arcs**
   - Natural curved motion paths
   - No robotic straight-line movement
   - Applies to gestures, turns, movements

7. **Secondary Action**
   - Supporting gestures enhance main action
   - Doesn't distract from primary
   - Adds richness and personality

### Transition Library

**Scene Transitions:**

**1. Standard Fade**
```
- Duration: 0.5 seconds
- Fade to: White (positive scenes) or Black (dramatic)
- Usage: 70% of transitions
- Smoothness: Linear fade
```

**2. Slide Wipe**
```
- Duration: 0.6 seconds
- Direction: Left→Right (time forward), Right→Left (flashback)
- Usage: Location changes, time progression
- Style: Clean edge, no blur
```

**3. Zoom Transition**
```
