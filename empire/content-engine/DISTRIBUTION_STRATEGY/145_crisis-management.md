### Crisis Management

**If Content Gets Flagged**:
1. Don't delete immediately (may confirm guilt)
2. Appeal through platform process
3. Document everything
4. Review what triggered flag
5. Adjust future content
6. Communicate transparently with community

**If Account Gets Suspended**:
1. Submit appeal immediately
2. Activate backup accounts
3. Notify community on other platforms
4. Document suspension reason
5. Consult with platform appeal specialists
6. Build on other platforms during suspension

**Backup Account Strategy**:
- Maintain verified backup accounts on all platforms
- Don't actively post (risk looking like spam)
- Build enough presence to activate if needed
- Document: "Official backup account for @HighNoonCartoon"
