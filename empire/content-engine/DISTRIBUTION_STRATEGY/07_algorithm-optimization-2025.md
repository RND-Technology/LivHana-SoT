#### Algorithm Optimization (2025)

**Key Algorithm Mechanics**:

- Algorithm categorizes content via captions, hashtags, and sounds
- Prioritizes watch time, engagement, and completion rate
- "For You Page" (FYP) is the holy grail of discovery
- Trending participation multiplies reach

**Critical Success Metrics**:

1. **Completion Rate**: Users watching entire video
2. **Engagement Rate**: Likes, comments, shares, saves
3. **Sound Usage**: Original vs. trending sounds
4. **Watch-Through**: Multiple watches increase weight

**Hashtag Strategy** (TikTok-Specific):

- **Optimal Number**: 3-6 hashtags per video
- **Mix Required**:
  - 1-2 broad hashtags (#fyp, #viral, #trending)
  - 2-3 niche hashtags (#cannabiseducation, #texascannabis, #hemplaw)
  - 1-2 campaign-specific (#HighNoonCartoon, #HNCseries)
- **Placement**: MUST be in caption (not comments)

**Finding Trending Content**:

- Use TikTok Creative Center (free tool)
- Monitor hashtag analytics for popularity curves
- Track trending sounds by region (Texas focus)
- Follow trending formats in education/satire niches

**Optimization Tactics for HNC**:

1. **Hook Strategy**
   - First frame: Bold text + character action
   - Pattern interrupt: Unexpected visual or sound
   - Curiosity gap: "You won't believe what happens..."

2. **Trend Leveraging**
   - Jump on trends within 24-48 hours
   - Adapt trends to cannabis education context
   - Use trending sounds even if not perfect fit

3. **Content Quality Focus**
   - High-resolution, clean animation
   - Clear audio mix
   - Proper lighting and color grading
   - No watermarks from other platforms

4. **Engagement Optimization**
   - Ask questions in captions
   - Use duet/stitch-friendly content
   - Create "storytime" formats
   - Poll stickers and interactive elements

5. **Posting Consistency**
   - Daily posting ideal (84 episodes = ~12 weeks)
   - Best times: Tuesday/Thursday 10am-6pm
   - Sunday 8pm is peak engagement time

**TikTok Series Strategy**:

- Use TikTok Series feature for premium content
- Create chapter markers for 84 episodes
- Offer "exclusive" episodes for followers
- Build anticipation with countdown content

**HNC-Specific Tactics**:

- **Character POV**: Film from character perspective
- **Text Overlay Heavy**: Assume audio off initially
- **Quick Pacing**: Cut every 2-3 seconds
- **Meme Integration**: Cannabis compliance as meme format
