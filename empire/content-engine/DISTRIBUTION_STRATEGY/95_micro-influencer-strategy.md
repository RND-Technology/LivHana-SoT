   - Side-by-side or sequential format
   - Collaborative storytelling

3. **Collaboration Video** (YouTube)
   - Influencer appears in HNC episode
   - HNC appears in influencer content
   - Double upload on both channels

4. **Twitter Thread Collaboration**
   - Co-write thread breaking down complex topic
   - Tag each other throughout
   - Combined expertise + audiences

Our combined audiences would benefit from both perspectives!
