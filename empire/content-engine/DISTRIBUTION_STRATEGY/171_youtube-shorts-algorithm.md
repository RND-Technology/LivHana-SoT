#### YouTube Shorts Algorithm

**Favor**:
- High view duration (% of video watched)
- Watched vs. swiped away ratio
- Loop/replay behavior
- Multi-platform shares
- Subscriber conversion

**Optimize**:
- Front-load value (don't bury lead)
- Strong hook (prevent swipes)
- Design for replaying
- Include subscribe CTA
- Share to other platforms yourself

**Avoid**:
- Click-bait that disappoints
- Slow pacing
- Unclear value proposition
- Heavy CTAs (too salesy)
