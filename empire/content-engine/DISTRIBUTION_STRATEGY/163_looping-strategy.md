### Looping Strategy

**Why Loops Matter**:

- Increases watch time metric
- Viewers re-watch to catch details
- Algorithm interprets as high engagement
- Natural on short-form platforms

**How to Create Loops**:

1. **Circular Narrative**
   - End where you began
   - "And that's why you need to..." â†’ back to hook
   - Satisfying completion that invites replay

2. **Visual Loop**
   - Last frame matches first frame
   - Seamless animation transition
   - No jarring cut

3. **Unanswered Question**
   - Hook poses question
   - Answer provided
   - End with related question (next episode)
   - "But wait, what about [related topic]?"

4. **Music Loop**
   - Song ends and restarts smoothly
   - Satisfying musical conclusion that resets
   - No awkward silence

**HNC Loop Strategy**:

- Standard episodes: Circular narrative back to hook
- Series episodes: Cliffhanger to next episode
- Standalone episodes: Satisfying visual/musical loop
- All episodes: Last frame CTA to "Watch next episode"
