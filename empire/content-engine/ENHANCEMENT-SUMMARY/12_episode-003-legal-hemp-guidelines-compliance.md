### Episode 003 - Legal Hemp Guidelines (Compliance)
**Before:**
```
Lt. Dan: "Alright listen up! Here's how we stay legal in Texas..."
Jesse: "Lt. Dan, nobody wants a compliance lecture."
Lt. Dan: "You WILL when DSHS shows up! ≤0.3% Δ9 THC, 21+ only!"
Liv Hana: "He's right. COAs or GTFO."
```

**After:**
```
Lt. Dan: "ATTENTION! October 2025 emergency rules are IN EFFECT!"
Jesse: "Lt. Dan, can we make this fun?"
Lt. Dan: "FUN?! You WILL have fun when you're NOT getting fined!
         ≤0.3% Δ9 THC, 21+ with ID verification, ISO-certified lab testing!"
Liv Hana: "He's right. New DSHS rules mean business. COAs or GTFO.
          License revocation is real."
```

**Improvements:**
- Added Oct 2025 timeline specificity
- Referenced emergency rules enforcement
- Increased stakes (fines, license revocation)
- Maintained humor while adding urgency
