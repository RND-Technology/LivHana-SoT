### Episode 004 - Customer Success Story (Medical)
**Before:**
Generic montage with revolution rhetoric

**After:**
```
Customer: "Y'all, I've been waiting for THIS my whole life!"
Jesse: "Tell us your story!"
Customer: "I'm a veteran with chronic pain. Texas finally became
          the 40th state for medical cannabis in 2025. Game changer!"
Liv Hana: "That's what we're here for. Legal, tested, compliant -
          Texas taking care of Texans."
Jesse: "From brick weed to premium flower. This is OUR revolution!"
```

**Improvements:**
- Real veteran perspective
