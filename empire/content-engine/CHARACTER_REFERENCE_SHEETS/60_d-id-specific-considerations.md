### D-ID Specific Considerations

**Face Animation:**
- Ensure clear eyes and mouth for lip-sync
- Expression should support dialogue tone
- Avoid extreme angles for primary speaking shots
- Allow subtle movements (breathing, blinking)

**Body Language:**
- Static shots with animated face (D-ID strength)
- Use different poses for scene variety
- Match pose to emotional content
- Character-appropriate stance
