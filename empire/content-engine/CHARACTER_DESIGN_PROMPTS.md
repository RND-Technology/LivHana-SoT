## CONSISTENCY TIPS

### Maintaining Character Consistency Across Generations

#### 1. **Reference Image Method**
- Generate your first "master" image using the most detailed prompt
- Save this image and reference it in subsequent prompts: "In the same style as [previous image], show [character name] with [new pose/expression]"
- Keep a folder of approved character images for reference

#### 2. **Prompt Consistency Formula**
Always include these elements in EVERY prompt for the same character:
- Character name and role
- Age range and ethnicity
- Hair style and color (specific)
- Key facial features (eyes, nose, jaw shape)
- Signature clothing items and colors
- Art style description (exact same wording)

#### 3. **Character Style Lock Phrases**
Use these exact phrases to maintain style:
- "Clean bold cartoon style with thick black outlines"
- "Simplified geometric shapes, flat colors with minimal shading"
- "Professional educational animation style, mobile-optimized"

#### 4. **Batch Generation Strategy**
- Generate all angles for ONE character before moving to next
- Use the same session when possible (DALL-E has short-term memory)
- Save all variations, select the most consistent set

#### 5. **Post-Generation Consistency Checks**
Review each generated image for:
- Facial feature consistency (eye shape, nose, mouth)
- Hair style and color match
- Clothing color and style match
- Overall art style match
- Expression appropriateness

### Advanced Consistency Techniques

#### Gen ID Method (If Available)
- Some DALL-E 3 implementations support Gen ID for character consistency
- Save the Gen ID from your first generation
- Reference it in subsequent prompts for the same character

#### LoRA Training (For Long-Term Series)
For ultimate consistency across 84 episodes:
1. Generate 10-15 high-quality images of each character
2. Use a LoRA training service (Shakker AI, Pykaso.ai, Replicate)
3. Train a custom character model for each character
4. Generate all future images using the trained LoRA model

#### Character Sheet First Method
1. Generate a character sheet with multiple angles in ONE image
2. Use this as reference for all future generations
3. Maintain consistency by referencing the character sheet

---

## BATCH GENERATION STRATEGY

### Recommended Generation Order

#### Phase 1: Master Images (Priority)
Generate these first for immediate production use:
1. **Jesse Niesen** - Front-Facing Neutral (PROMPT 1)
2. **Liv Hana** - Front-Facing Neutral (PROMPT 1)
3. **Chief Steve** - Front-Facing Anxious (PROMPT 1)
4. **Lt. Dan** - Front-Facing Stern (PROMPT 1)
5. **Aubrey Awfuls** - Front-Facing Menacing (PROMPT 1)

#### Phase 2: Expression Sheets
Generate expression variety for dialogue scenes:
1. **Jesse Niesen** - Expression Sheet (PROMPT 4)
2. **Liv Hana** - Expression Sheet (PROMPT 4)
3. **Chief Steve** - Expression Sheet (PROMPT 4)
4. **Lt. Dan** - Expression Sheet (PROMPT 4)
5. **Aubrey Awfuls** - Expression Sheet (PROMPT 4)

#### Phase 3: Additional Angles
Generate alternate angles for visual variety:
1. All characters - 3/4 View (PROMPT 2)
2. All characters - Profile View (PROMPT 3)

#### Phase 4: Full Body & Action Poses
Generate for intro sequences and special episodes:
1. All characters - Full Body Standing (PROMPT 5)
2. All characters - Action Pose (PROMPT 6)

### Generation Tips
- Generate during off-peak hours if using API limits
- Save ALL variations (even rejects) for reference
- Use consistent file naming: `CHARACTER_ANGLE_EXPRESSION_v1.png`
- Create a "Selected Assets" folder with approved images only
- Document which images are used in which episodes

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Character looks different between generations
**Solution:**
- Copy the EXACT character description from first successful generation
- Lock down specific details: "exactly 3 buttons visible on shirt"
- Reference previous image: "in the exact same style as previous generation"

#### Issue: DALL-E changes art style between prompts
**Solution:**
- Always include "clean bold cartoon style with thick black outlines"
- Add "simplified geometric shapes, flat colors"
- Reference specific style: "in the style of educational YouTube animation"

#### Issue: Face not animating well in D-ID
**Solution:**
- Increase face size: crop closer to head and shoulders
- Ensure eyes and mouth are clearly defined
- Use neutral or slight smile expression (animates best)
- Avoid extreme angles (stick to front-facing or 3/4 view)

#### Issue: Background distracting in final video
**Solution:**
- Use solid color backgrounds only
- Choose warm neutrals: terracotta, sandy beige, dusty blue
- Or use D-ID's background removal feature

#### Issue: Character features too detailed for mobile viewing
**Solution:**
- Add "simplified geometric shapes" to prompt
- Specify "mobile-optimized, clear features"
- Increase outline thickness: "thick bold black outlines"

## NEXT STEPS

### After Generating Character Assets

1. **Test in D-ID Platform**
   - Upload each character master image
   - Generate test animations with sample dialogue
   - Verify lip-sync quality and expression range

2. **Create Character Library**
   - Organize images by character > angle > expression
   - Document which images work best for which episode types
   - Build a "quick select" folder for common scenes

3. **LoRA Training (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Collect 10-15 best images per character
   - Train custom LoRA models for long-term consistency
   - Use for Episode 10+ when consistency is critical

4. **Integrate with Production Pipeline**
   - Link character images to episode scripts (episode-X.json files)
   - Document which character images are used in which episodes
   - Create templates for recurring scene types

5. **Iterate and Improve**
   - Review animation results from first 5 episodes
   - Refine prompts based on what works best in D-ID
   - Update this guide with lessons learned
