### Parallel Production Workflow

To maximize efficiency, **parallel production** is recommended:

#### Phase 1: Asset Generation (All Episodes at Once)

**Suno Music Generation:**
- Generate all 7 music tracks simultaneously in Suno
- Estimated time: 20 minutes total (Suno processes 2-3 minutes per track)
- Cost: $0.70 (7 tracks × $0.10 per track)

**ElevenLabs Voice Generation:**
- Script and generate all voice lines for all episodes
- Batch API calls for efficiency
- Estimated time: 10 minutes total (API latency)
- Cost: $0.30 (7 episodes × ~$0.04 per episode)

**Runway Video Generation:**
- Queue all 28 video scenes (7 episodes × 4 scenes each)
- Runway Gen-3 processes 4x faster than real-time
- Estimated time: 90 minutes total (15 seconds per scene × 28 scenes)
- Cost: $28.00 (28 scenes × ~$1.00 per 15-second scene)

**Phase 1 Total Time:** ~90 minutes (parallel processing)
**Phase 1 Total Cost:** $29.00

---

#### Phase 2: Episode Assembly (Parallel Workstations)

**Option A: Sequential Assembly (1 Editor)**
- Assemble episodes one by one
- Time: 15 minutes per episode × 7 = 105 minutes
- Tools: Adobe Premiere Pro / Final Cut Pro / DaVinci Resolve

**Option B: Parallel Assembly (4 Editors or 4 Workstations)**
- Divide episodes across 4 workstations
- Workstation 1: Episodes 15, 19
- Workstation 2: Episodes 16, 20
- Workstation 3: Episodes 17, 21
- Workstation 4: Episode 18
- Time: ~30 minutes (2 episodes per workstation max)

**Assembly Tasks (Per Episode):**
1. Import assets (music, voiceover, video scenes)
2. Sync voiceover to video scenes (timeline alignment)
3. Layer background music (60s loop, volume ducking under voices)
4. Add text overlays:
   - Episode title (0-3s)
   - Key messaging (15-20s, 35-40s)
   - CTA with URL (55-60s)
   - Hashtags (bottom, persistent)
5. Color grading (match brand style, Texas warm tones)
6. Audio mixing (voiceover clear, music supporting, no clipping)
7. Export settings:
   - Resolution: 1080x1920 (9:16 vertical)
   - Frame rate: 30fps
   - Codec: H.264
   - Bitrate: 10 Mbps
   - Audio: AAC 192kbps
8. Generate thumbnail (3 variants per episode for A/B testing)

**Phase 2 Total Time (Parallel):** ~30 minutes
**Phase 2 Total Cost:** $0 (in-house editing)

### FFmpeg Assembly Script (Automated)

For maximum automation, use FFmpeg command-line assembly:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# HNC Episode Assembly Script
# Usage: ./assemble_episode.sh [episode_number]

EPISODE=$1
MUSIC_FILE="output/music/episode-${EPISODE}.mp3"
VOICE_DIR="output/voices/episode-${EPISODE}/"
VIDEO_DIR="output/video/episode-${EPISODE}/"
OUTPUT="output/final-videos/HNC_EP${EPISODE}_FINAL.mp4"

# Step 1: Concatenate video scenes
ffmpeg -i "${VIDEO_DIR}scene_1.mp4" \
       -i "${VIDEO_DIR}scene_2.mp4" \
       -i "${VIDEO_DIR}scene_3.mp4" \
       -i "${VIDEO_DIR}scene_4.mp4" \
       -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v][2:v][3:v]concat=n=4:v=1:a=0[vout]" \
       -map "[vout]" temp_video.mp4

# Step 2: Merge voiceover audio files
ffmpeg -i "${VOICE_DIR}line_1.mp3" \
       -i "${VOICE_DIR}line_2.mp3" \
       -i "${VOICE_DIR}line_3.mp3" \
       -i "${VOICE_DIR}line_4.mp3" \
       -filter_complex "concat=n=4:v=0:a=1[aout]" \
       -map "[aout]" temp_voice.mp3

# Step 3: Mix voiceover + music
ffmpeg -i temp_voice.mp3 \
       -i "${MUSIC_FILE}" \
       -filter_complex "[1:a]volume=0.3[music];[0:a][music]amix=inputs=2:duration=shortest[aout]" \
       -map "[aout]" temp_audio.mp3

# Step 4: Combine video + audio
ffmpeg -i temp_video.mp4 \
       -i temp_audio.mp3 \
       -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 20 \
       -c:a aac -b:a 192k \
       -movflags +faststart \
       "${OUTPUT}"

# Cleanup temp files
rm temp_video.mp4 temp_voice.mp3 temp_audio.mp3

echo "Episode ${EPISODE} assembled: ${OUTPUT}"
```

**Automation Benefits:**
- Consistent quality across all episodes
- Faster processing (no manual editing)
- Repeatable workflow
- Easy to scale to 84 episodes
