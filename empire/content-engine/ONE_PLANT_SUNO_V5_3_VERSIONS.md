# "ONE PLANT ONE LAW ONE TEXAS" - 3 SUNO V5 VERSIONS

## RESEARCH SUMMARY: Suno v5 Best Practices (2025)

### Key Optimizations for v5:
1. **Vocal Direction**: Specific timbre/tone (smoky, airy, raspy, warm, bright)
2. **Production Details**: Analog glue compression, tape saturation, stereo width
3. **Emotional Progression**: Map emotional arc through song structure
4. **Real Music Terminology**: BPM, key, harmony, dynamics explicitly stated
5. **Performance Cues**: Breath releases, dynamic swells, legato phrasing
6. **Genre Blending**: Combine influences for unique sound
7. **A/B Testing**: Generate multiple variations, test for virality

### Viral Song Formula:
- Hook in first 15 seconds (Chorus or catchy instrumental)
- Emotional escalation (build from verse â†’ chorus)
- Memorable repetitive elements (chant-able chorus)
- Production quality (studio-grade mix, clear vocals)
- Authenticity (message that resonates with audience)

## VERSION 1: HIP-HOP SPOKEN WORD (Political Fire)

**Target Audience:** Hip-hop heads, policy wonks, cannabis advocates
**Viral Potential:** High - political message + rhythmic delivery
**YouTube Strategy:** Lyric video with Texas policy visuals

### SUNO V5 PROMPT

```
Style Description:
Political hip-hop meets spoken word poetry | 90s boom-bap influence with modern minimalist production | BPM 90 | Key: F Minor | commanding conversational delivery with raspy authoritative male vocals | minimalist groove: steady 808 bass, sparse piano hits, snare on 2 and 4 | analog glue compression; subtle tape saturation; crisp vocal presence | emotional arc: determined confidence â†’ rising momentum â†’ triumphant declaration | breath control; dynamic swells on choruses; legato flow on verses | cinematic strings swell before final chorus

Production Notes:
- Low-end focus: warm 808 bass, sub-bass rumble
- Mid-range clarity: vocals sit on top, clear enunciation
- High-end sparkle: subtle hi-hat, crisp snare
- Stereo width: narrow verses (focused), wide chorus (expansive)
- Dynamics: verse at 70%, chorus at 100%

Performance Direction:
Male vocals: deep raspy timbre, warm authoritative tone, confident but not aggressive, conversational cadence with emphasis on key words ("fact," "Texas," "one"), breath releases after "One plant" hook, dynamic swell into chorus
```

### LYRICS (Optimized with Structure Tags)

```
[Intro - Instrumental]
[Piano hits, 808 bass fade in, 4 bars]

[Verse 1]
Texas Truth and Safety Act
A green hope, a legacy
That's a fact
Standing tall, standing free
Turning red tape into symphony

Policy stacks like bricks in line
Every clause, every vote, divine
In chambers where the lights don't shine
One plant whispers, "The future is mine"

[Pre-Chorus]
[808 bass intensifies, strings enter]
Pages rustle like leaves in fall
A thousand voices in a marble hall
Do you hear it? Do you hear the call?

[Chorus - Anthemic]
One plant, one law, one Texas
One seed, one dream, it connects us
From the fields to the floors, no guessing
One plant, one law, one Texas

[Verse 2]
Subsection B, yeah, by the people for the people
Yes it's true, it's what's best for Texas so we push it through
The Next Lieutenant Governor with the bold debut
Turning "maybe" into "yes," and the skies turned blue

Committees grind, yeah, they test your will
Late nights, long fights, but the ink spills
Onto paper that changes hills
One plant grows, and the world stands still

[Pre-Chorus]
[Strings swell, tension builds]
Pages rustle like leaves in fall
A thousand voices in a marble hall
Do you hear it? Do you hear the call?

[Chorus - Full Power]
One plant, one law, one Texas
One seed, one dream, it connects us
From the fields to the floors, no guessing
One plant, one law, one Texas

[Bridge - Spoken Word Breakdown]
[Sparse: only 808 bass and finger snaps]
One plant grows in the heart of the Lone Star State
One law rewrites what prohibition tried to dictate
One Texas leads while the whole nation waits
One seed of truth, and we change our fate

[Final Chorus - Maximum Energy]
[Full production: bass, drums, piano, strings]
One plant, one law, one Texas
One seed, one dream, it connects us
From the fields to the floors, no guessing
One plant, one law, one Texas

[Outro - Instrumental Fade]
[Piano and bass fade over 8 bars, final whisper: "One Texas..."]
```
