### Modified Approach

**No modifications to existing files** - New optimized engine runs alongside existing codebase:
- Original engine: `hnc-autonomous-engine.mjs` (preserved)
- Optimized engine: `hnc-autonomous-engine-optimized.mjs` (new)
- API: `src/api.js` (unchanged, can integrate optimized engine)
- Pipeline: `src/test-pipeline.js` (unchanged)

**Deployment Strategy:**
1. Test optimized engine independently ✅ DONE
2. Validate performance metrics ✅ DONE
3. Compare output quality ✅ DONE
4. Switch API to use optimized engine (pending)
5. Deprecate original engine (pending)
