### Getting Started in 5 Steps

1. **Start with Jesse Niesen**
   - Copy PROMPT 1 (Front-Facing Neutral)
   - Generate 2-3 variations
   - Select the best for consistency

2. **Generate All Front-Facing Neutrals**
   - Use PROMPT 1 for each character
   - This creates your "base" character set
   - Save approved versions as "MASTER" files

3. **Test with D-ID**
   - Upload one character image to D-ID
   - Test with sample dialogue
   - Verify animation quality before generating rest

4. **Generate Expression Sheets**
   - Use PROMPT 4 for each character
   - Crop individual expressions from sheet
   - Save for future episode use

5. **Build Character Library**
   - Organize by character, then by angle/expression
   - Document which images work best in D-ID
   - Update this guide with notes on successful variations
