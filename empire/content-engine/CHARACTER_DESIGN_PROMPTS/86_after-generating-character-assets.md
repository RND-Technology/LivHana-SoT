### After Generating Character Assets

1. **Test in D-ID Platform**
   - Upload each character master image
   - Generate test animations with sample dialogue
   - Verify lip-sync quality and expression range

2. **Create Character Library**
   - Organize images by character > angle > expression
   - Document which images work best for which episode types
   - Build a "quick select" folder for common scenes

3. **LoRA Training (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Collect 10-15 best images per character
   - Train custom LoRA models for long-term consistency
   - Use for Episode 10+ when consistency is critical

4. **Integrate with Production Pipeline**
   - Link character images to episode scripts (episode-X.json files)
   - Document which character images are used in which episodes
   - Create templates for recurring scene types

5. **Iterate and Improve**
   - Review animation results from first 5 episodes
   - Refine prompts based on what works best in D-ID
   - Update this guide with lessons learned
