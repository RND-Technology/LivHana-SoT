### Cannabis Content Considerations:

**Platform Restrictions:**
- **California:** EXPLICITLY prohibits cartoons in cannabis advertising, marketing, packaging, labeling
  - Definition: "Simplified or exaggerated illustration used for humor, satire, storytelling, or animation"
  - **CRITICAL:** HNC must position as EDUCATIONAL, not advertising/marketing
- Many states prohibit content targeting under-21 audiences (including cartoon characters)

**YouTube Policy (2021+):**
- Eased restrictions on cannabis content
- Allows monetization ONLY for "objective, informative, educational, non-glorified" manner
- Cannabis educators more visible since 2021

**HNC Compliance Strategy:**
1. Position as EDUCATIONAL SATIRE about cannabis regulations
2. Include disclaimers: "Educational purposes only, not product advertising"
3. Focus on compliance education, legal news, industry satire
4. Target 21+ audience explicitly
5. Avoid direct product endorsement
6. Emphasize legal compliance aspect of series

**Content That Works:**
- Blogs, guides, YouTube content providing value without direct promotion
- Educational content that doesn't directly advertise products
- Trust-building content

---

### Vertical Video Best Practices (9:16 Format)

### Technical Specs:

**Optimal Specifications:**

- **Resolution:** 1080 x 1920 pixels (1080p)
- **File Format:** MP4 (Android), MOV (iOS)
- **File Size:** Under 500 MB
- **Frame Rate:** 30fps or 60fps

**Why 9:16 Vertical:**
- Perfectly fills entire mobile screen
- Immersive experience keeps users engaged
- TikTok algorithm favors vertical videos
- 30-50% more engagement than horizontal

---

### Safe Zones for UI Elements:

**Critical Rule:**
Keep key visuals and text in center 80% of screen (vertical and horizontal) to avoid overlap with:
- Profile names
- Action buttons
- Platform UI elements

---

### Animation Creation Workflow for Vertical:

**Adobe After Effects:**
1. Create new composition: 1080x1920 (9:16)
2. Design with center-weighted composition
3. Test with platform UI overlays

**Content Optimization:**
- Add captions for silent viewers (85% watch without sound)
- Clear subject framing
- Center-weighted composition retains viewers longer

---

### Timing & Length:

**2025 Optimal Lengths:**
- **6-10 seconds:** Ultra-short attention grabbers
- **15-30 seconds:** Standard viral length
- **60 seconds:** Maximum for sustained engagement
- **3-5 minutes:** Educational deep-dives (YouTube Shorts upper limit)

**Critical Insight:**
In 2025, animations lasting just 6-10 seconds are strategically used to grab attention, deliver punchy message, and drive action.

## Advanced Techniques

### Character Consistency Across Episodes

**LoRA Training Workflow:**

1. **Collect Training Data (20-50 images):**
   - Generate 50 images of Liv using Midjourney with Omni Reference
   - Various angles: front, 3/4, profile, back
   - Various expressions: neutral, smiling, surprised, serious
   - Various poses: standing, sitting, gesturing

2. **Train Custom LoRA (Stable Diffusion):**
   ```
   Training tool: Kohya_ss or EveryDream2
   Training images: 50 images of Liv
   Training steps: 1500-2000
   Learning rate: 0.0001
   Resolution: 1024x1024
   ```

3. **Use LoRA in Production:**
   ```
   Prompt: "livhnc, speaking to camera, office background" <lora:liv_character:0.8>
   ```
   - LoRA ensures Liv looks identical across all scenes/episodes
   - No need for Omni Reference every time

4. **Export to Video Tools:**
   - Use LoRA-generated consistent images in Kling AI/HeyGen
   - Maintain perfect character consistency across 100+ episodes

### Viral Growth Hacking Strategies

**Content Calendar Optimization:**
- **Monday:** Legal compliance tips (high engagement start of week)
- **Wednesday:** Grower education (mid-week educational content)
- **Friday:** Satirical/comedic take on week's cannabis news (entertainment for weekend)

**Hook Formulas (First 3 Seconds):**
1. "You won't believe what California just banned..."
2. "Getting fired for legal cannabis? Here's the truth..."
3. "This compliance mistake costs $50,000..."

**Engagement Triggers:**
- End each video with question: "Have you experienced this? Comment below!"
- Use polls in TikTok/Instagram versions
- Pin controversial (but accurate) comment to drive discussion

**Cross-Platform Strategy:**
```
TikTok: 15-second comedic version
YouTube Shorts: 60-second educational deep-dive
Instagram Reels: 30-second visual-heavy version
LinkedIn: 90-second professional compliance focus
```

Each platform gets optimized content, not same video everywhere.
