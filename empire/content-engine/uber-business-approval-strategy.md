Subject: Business Account Verification - Legal Hemp Delivery Service (Existing Customer via Nash)

Dear Uber for Business Team,

I'm writing to provide context for our account verification and ensure smooth approval for our Uber Direct API access.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW:
Company: Reggie & Dro Cannabis Store & Social Club
Location: San Antonio, Texas
Website: reggieanddro.com
Annual Revenue: $1M+
Business Type: Legal hemp-derived cannabis retail (CBD, Delta-8, Delta-9 THC <0.3%)

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE:
âœ… Operating under Texas HB 1325 (2019 Farm Bill) - Legal hemp products only
âœ… All products contain <0.3% Delta-9 THC (federally legal hemp)
âœ… Texas Sales & Use Tax Permit: [Your Number]
âœ… Texas Retail Dealer's Permit: [Your Number]
âœ… General Liability Insurance with cannabis rider
âœ… Age verification required (21+) on all orders
âœ… Third-party lab testing for all products
âœ… Zero marijuana products (only legal hemp derivatives)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WE'RE ALREADY YOUR CUSTOMER:
We have been using Uber drivers since November 2023 via Nash/Square Online's white-label API:
- $1M+ in delivery orders processed through your network
- 11+ months of successful, compliant deliveries
- Zero compliance issues or customer complaints
- Proven track record with your platform

WHY WE NEED DIRECT API ACCESS:
1. Upgrading from Square to Lightspeed POS (enterprise platform)
2. Building superior middleware to eliminate Nash intermediary
3. Direct integration reduces costs for both parties
4. Scaling operations across Texas (Houston, Dallas, Austin)
5. Multi-provider intelligent routing for better service
6. Professional API integration with real-time tracking

TEXAS LEGAL FRAMEWORK:
Texas HB 1325 (2019) legalized hemp and hemp-derived products containing <0.3% Delta-9 THC. Our products fall entirely within this legal framework. We are NOT a marijuana dispensary - we sell legal hemp products that comply with both Texas state law and federal Farm Bill regulations.

DELIVERY PROTOCOL:
- Age verification at checkout (21+ required)
- ID verification at delivery (driver confirms age)
- Professional packaging (child-resistant, opaque)
- Real-time order tracking via Lightspeed POS
- Secure payment processing via Authorize.net
- 35-mile delivery radius from San Antonio store

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- OAuth 2.0 / JWT authentication ready
- Integration with Lightspeed POS system
- Real-time order sync and tracking
- Automated compliance reporting
- Professional development team (AI/frontier technology)

DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST:
- Texas Retail Dealer's Permit
- Sales Tax Permit
- General Liability Insurance Certificate (cannabis rider)
- Third-party lab Certificates of Analysis (COA)
- 11 months of successful delivery history via Nash/Uber
- Age verification process documentation
- Lightspeed POS contract (proof of enterprise upgrade)

BUSINESS CASE:
We are already generating significant volume through your network via Nash. Direct API access:
- Formalizes our existing partnership
- Improves margins for both Uber and our business
- Increases order volume as we scale across Texas
- Demonstrates professional, compliant operation

We appreciate Uber's diligence in account verification. Cannabis commerce requires careful compliance, but our business operates entirely within legal parameters. We've successfully navigated this with Nash, DoorDash, and other partners.

Please let me know if you need any additional documentation.

Thank you for your partnership.

Best regards,

Jesse Niesen
CEO & Founder

P.S. We're building a multi-provider delivery system with AI-powered intelligent routing. Uber Direct is a critical component of our growth strategy as we scale from $1M to $10M+ revenue across Texas.
