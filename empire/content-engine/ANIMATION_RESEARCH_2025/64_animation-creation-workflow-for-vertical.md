### Animation Creation Workflow for Vertical:

**Adobe After Effects:**
1. Create new composition: 1080x1920 (9:16)
2. Design with center-weighted composition
3. Test with platform UI overlays

**Content Optimization:**
- Add captions for silent viewers (85% watch without sound)
- Clear subject framing
- Center-weighted composition retains viewers longer
