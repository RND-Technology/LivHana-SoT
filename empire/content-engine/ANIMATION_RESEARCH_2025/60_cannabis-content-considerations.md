### Cannabis Content Considerations:

**Platform Restrictions:**
- **California:** EXPLICITLY prohibits cartoons in cannabis advertising, marketing, packaging, labeling
  - Definition: "Simplified or exaggerated illustration used for humor, satire, storytelling, or animation"
  - **CRITICAL:** HNC must position as EDUCATIONAL, not advertising/marketing
- Many states prohibit content targeting under-21 audiences (including cartoon characters)

**YouTube Policy (2021+):**
- Eased restrictions on cannabis content
- Allows monetization ONLY for "objective, informative, educational, non-glorified" manner
- Cannabis educators more visible since 2021

**HNC Compliance Strategy:**
1. Position as EDUCATIONAL SATIRE about cannabis regulations
2. Include disclaimers: "Educational purposes only, not product advertising"
3. Focus on compliance education, legal news, industry satire
4. Target 21+ audience explicitly
5. Avoid direct product endorsement
6. Emphasize legal compliance aspect of series

**Content That Works:**
- Blogs, guides, YouTube content providing value without direct promotion
- Educational content that doesn't directly advertise products
- Trust-building content
