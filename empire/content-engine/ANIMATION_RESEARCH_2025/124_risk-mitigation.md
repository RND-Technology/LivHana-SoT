### Risk Mitigation

**Cannabis Content Restrictions:**

- Always include "Educational Purposes Only" disclaimer
- Position as compliance education, not product marketing
- Target 21+ audience explicitly
- Avoid cartoon aesthetic in product marketing contexts
- Focus on legal/regulatory education angle

**Platform Diversification:**

- Don't rely on single platform (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram)
- Build email list for direct audience access
- Create owned platform (website) for long-term content hosting

**AI Tool Dependence:**

- Subscribe to multiple video generation tools (Kling + Runway backup)
- Have multiple voice providers (Fish Audio + Chatterbox backup)
- Export and archive all generated assets locally
