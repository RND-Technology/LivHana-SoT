### 3. **D-ID** (Current Stack - Keep or Replace?)

**Recommendation:** REPLACE with HeyGen for primary production

**When to Keep D-ID:**
- Already invested in D-ID workflows
- Need quick, simple image-to-video animation
- Budget constraints favor D-ID's pricing

**Limitations:**
- More "uncanny valley" effect than competitors
- Less sophisticated lip-sync than HeyGen
- Fewer language options
- More basic feature set
