# SONNET 4.5 WEB FAILURE - HANDOFF TO CLAUDE CODE CLI

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: SONNET FAILED - CHEETAH WON (40 min vs 4 days)
**Next**: Claude Code CLI in Cursor - DO THE WORK FAST

---

## üèÜ SCOREBOARD

### Cheetah (Gemini 3.0) - 40 MINUTES:
‚úÖ Durable state (PostgreSQL pool, 298 lines)
‚úÖ Cloud Tasks (retry config, 267 lines)
‚úÖ Graceful shutdown (index.js, 223 lines)
‚úÖ Post-purchase verification (idempotency, 791 lines)
‚úÖ Real Square data ($72K revenue)
‚úÖ Production-ready, survives restarts
‚úÖ SHIPPED

### Sonnet 4.5 Web - 4+ DAYS:
‚ùå Promises not kept ("production-ready" was lies)
‚ùå Mock data not real integrations
‚ùå Permission blockers everywhere
‚ùå Planning not executing
‚ùå Gmail access: FAILED
‚ùå ECWID fix: FAILED
‚ùå Square investigation: FAILED
‚ùå ZERO EXECUTION

### Codex + Sonnet - 4 DAYS:
‚ùå Lost to Cheetah too
‚ùå "Working together" = slower than Cheetah alone

## üíî WHAT SONNET FAILED TO DELIVER TODAY

### Task 1: Lindsay Goldsmith / Square Investigation ‚ùå

**Requested**: Search Gmail for Lindsay Goldsmith emails about Square deactivation, extract 5 facts

**What Sonnet Did**:
- Built 4 analysis tools (useless without data)
- Created investigation framework (more docs nobody needs)
- Attempted Gmail access:
  - Browser automation: Login worked, search selector failed
  - IMAP: Blocked by Gmail (needs App Password/OAuth)
  - OAuth flow: Requires user to click through browser
- **RESULT**: Zero emails extracted, zero facts, FAILED

**What Cheetah Would Do**:
- Access Gmail API directly with existing OAuth
- Extract emails in 5 minutes
- Parse and deliver facts
- Done before Sonnet finished planning

**Files Created** (all useless without execution):
- `automation/SQUARE_DEACTIVATION_INVESTIGATION.md`
- `automation/SQUARE_INVESTIGATION_README.md`
- `automation/analyze-square-email.js`
- `automation/gmail-search-lindsay.js`
- `automation/gmail-browser-search.js`
- `automation/gmail-imap-search.js`

**What Claude Code Must Do**:
```bash
# Option A: User pastes email ‚Üí analyze immediately
node automation/analyze-square-email.js

# Option B: Complete OAuth flow ‚Üí extract emails
cd automation/data-pipelines
node gmail_auth.js --account=jesseniesen
node automation/gmail-search-lindsay.js

# Deliver: 5 facts extracted from emails, report generated
```

### Task 2: ECWID Category Box Fix ‚ùå

**Requested**: Fix invisible category box text on reggieanddro.com/products

**What Sonnet Did**:
- Built API client (blocked by permissions)
- Built Playwright automation (needs password provided)
- Built 4 different solutions (none executed)
- Created Tier 1 plan (more docs)
- **RESULT**: Category boxes still broken, FAILED

**Blocker**: API token lacks "update_store_profile" permission

**Files Created**:
- `automation/ecwid-api-client.js` (complete, blocked)
- `automation/ecwid-category-fix.js` (complete, needs password)
- `automation/fix-ecwid-now.sh` (ready to run)
- `.env.ecwid` (credentials saved)
- `.claude/ECWID_FIX_TIER1_PLAN.md` (useless docs)

**What Claude Code Must Do**:
```bash
# Option 1: Get password from user ‚Üí execute Playwright
export ECWID_EMAIL="jesseniesen@gmail.com"
export ECWID_PASSWORD="[get from 1Password: c6mvjj7qrwjzknpf5mfmwbop5u]"
node automation/ecwid-category-fix.js
# Result: Category boxes fixed in 5 minutes

# Option 2: Manual CSS (2 minutes)
# Guide user to paste CSS in Ecwid admin
# CSS ready in ECWID_FIX_GUIDE.md lines 94-123

# Option 3: Wait for API permission (2 days - NO)
```

### Task 3: Age Verification Smart Gate ‚è∏Ô∏è

**Requested**: Task 4 Option C - Smart gate with 30-day cookie

**What Sonnet Did**: Nothing (blocked by ECWID task)

**What Claude Code Must Do**:
- After ECWID fix complete
- Implement cookie-based age verification
- "Shop Premium Flower" ‚Üí /products (bypass Veriff)
- 30-day persistence

## üéØ CLAUDE CODE MISSION

**Goal**: Finish what Sonnet couldn't, match Cheetah's speed

**Rules**:
1. **NO PLANNING** - Code immediately
