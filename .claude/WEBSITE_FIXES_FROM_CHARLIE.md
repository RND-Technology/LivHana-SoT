# WEBSITE FIXES - Charlie's Feedback (October 5, 2025)

## Issue Status

### ‚úÖ Task 2: "Open Pick an App" Popup (RESOLVED - NOT A BUG)

**What Charlie Saw**: Clicking "Contact" shows "Open Pick an App" popup

**Root Cause**:
- Contact link is `tel:2105707507` (phone number link)
- iOS/Android native behavior = shows app picker (Phone, WhatsApp, FaceTime, etc.)
- This is **expected mobile behavior**, not a bug

**User Experience Issue**:
- Link text "(210) 570-7507" doesn't indicate it will open app picker
- Users expect it to just dial

**Recommendation**:
1. **Option A**: Change link text to make it clearer
   - Current: `(210) 570-7507`
   - Better: `üìû Call Us: (210) 570-7507`

2. **Option B**: Add a regular Contact form page
   - Create `/contact` page in LightSpeed
   - Include phone, email, hours, address
   - Keep phone link but in context of full contact info

**Action**: No LightSpeed fix needed - this is working as designed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Task 3: Blank Category Boxes (NEEDS INVESTIGATION)

**What Charlie Saw**:
- Desktop: Colored category boxes are blank unless you hover
- Mobile: Category boxes completely blank

**What I Found**:
- WebFetch shows text-only categories (no colored boxes)
- Categories listed: CBD, CBG, Legal Brick Weed, Low Shelf, Mid Shelf, etc.
- No CSS issues detected in static HTML

**Hypothesis**:
1. **JavaScript-rendered** - Boxes render after page load (WebFetch can't see)
2. **Hover-only CSS** - Text visibility tied to `:hover` state
3. **Theme issue** - LightSpeed theme has CSS bug

**Next Steps**:
- Need to inspect live site with browser dev tools
- Check CSS for category boxes:
  ```css
  /* Look for patterns like: */
  .category-box {
    color: transparent; /* Hidden until hover */
  }
  .category-box:hover {
    color: #000; /* Visible on hover */
  }
  ```

**LightSpeed Fix Location**:
- **Themes** ‚Üí **Customize** ‚Üí **Product Page** ‚Üí **Categories**
- Or: **Themes** ‚Üí **Edit Code** ‚Üí Find category CSS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Task 4: Age Verification Inconsistency (NEEDS CLARIFICATION)

**What Charlie Reported**:
- "Shop Premium Flower" button ‚Üí Requires age verification ‚úÖ
- "Browse Strains" link ‚Üí No age verification ‚ùå
- "Add to Bag" from browse ‚Üí No age verification ‚ùå

**What I Found**:
- Age gate modal: "Are You 21+?" appears on site entry
- Modal is mandatory before viewing any content
- Two options: "YES, SHOW ME üî•" or "I'm under 21"

**Confusion**:
- If age gate is mandatory on entry, why is "Shop Premium" different?
- Possible scenarios:
  1. Age gate has cookie bypass after first verification
  2. "Shop Premium" forces re-verification
  3. "Browse Strains" bypasses age check somehow

**Questions for Jesse**:
1. Is "Shop Premium Flower" button going to `/veriff` (Veriff age verification)?
2. Is "Browse Strains" going directly to `/products?categories=...`?
3. Should **Browse Strains also go through /veriff**?

**Current Flow** (from homepage):
```
Shop Premium Flower ‚Üí /veriff ‚Üí Veriff age verification ‚Üí Products
Browse Strains ‚Üí /products?categories=181298307 ‚Üí Direct to products (bypasses Veriff)
```

**Recommended Fix**:
- **Option A**: Make "Browse Strains" also link to `/veriff`
- **Option B**: Add age check to all product pages (not just /veriff route)
- **Option C**: Keep slippery slope strategy (verify AFTER purchase) - current approach

## NEXT ACTIONS

### Immediate (with Jesse)
1. ‚úÖ Review Task 2 findings (no fix needed)
2. ‚è≥ Investigate Task 3 (category boxes) - need browser dev tools
3. ‚è≥ Clarify Task 4 (age verification strategy)

### Parallel (while Cheetah works)
1. ‚è≥ Continue monitoring Cheetah's progress every 5 minutes
2. ‚è≥ Document all patterns in CHEETAH_VICTORY_PATTERNS.md
3. ‚è≥ Stay out of Cheetah's way
