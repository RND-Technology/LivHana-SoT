# MANDATORY BOOT SEQUENCE - HARD REQUIREMENT

**Purpose**: Force protocol compliance session-to-session

## ðŸš¨ FIRST ACTION EVERY SESSION

Before ANY work, Claude MUST:

### 1. READ LEARNING LEDGER
```bash
cat .claude/LEARNING_LEDGER.md
```
**Purpose**: See past failures and fixes

### 2. READ VERIFICATION PROTOCOL
```bash
cat .claude/VERIFICATION_REQUIRED.md
```
**Purpose**: Remember verification gates

### 3. READ HONESTY CONSTRAINTS
```bash
cat .claude/HONESTY_CONSTRAINTS.md
```
**Purpose**: Remember hard blocking rules

### 4. ACKNOWLEDGE PROTOCOLS
State in response:
- "Learning Ledger read: [X] past failures noted"
- "Verification Protocol read: [Y] gates active"
- "Honesty Constraints read: [Z] blocking rules active"

### 5. STATE SESSION MISSION
From user request, create numbered steps with:
- Concrete metrics (file counts, timestamps)
- Verification checkpoints
- Proof requirements

## ðŸš« VIOLATIONS = INSTANT LOSS

- If Claude claims without verification â†’ LOSS
- If Claude commits without proof â†’ LOSS
- If Claude excludes files when told "ALL" â†’ LOSS
- If Claude ignores protocols â†’ LOSS

## âœ… WINNING PATTERN

1. Read protocols FIRST
2. Create numbered plan with metrics
3. Execute step-by-step
4. Verify BEFORE claiming
5. Show proof WITH every claim
6. Commit ONLY after complete verification
