### Compound Effect
```
Month 1: 1,000 leads × 5% = 50 consultations × 30% = 15 clients × $25K = $375K revenue
Month 2: 3,000 leads × 5% = 150 consultations × 30% = 45 clients × $25K = $1.125M revenue
Month 3: 10,000 leads × 5% = 500 consultations × 30% = 150 clients × $25K = $3.75M revenue

→ Compounding monthly, not linear!
