### vs Google Ads

**Google's Weakness**: Generic targeting, no real product knowledge
**LivHana's Strength**: Real customer data, verified outcomes

**Example**:
- Google: "Buy CBD oil" (generic ad to everyone)
- LivHana: "Based on your sleep issues and preference for natural solutions, try this specific strain that 87% of similar customers reordered" (personalized, data-driven)

**Result**: 10x conversion rate (0.5% â†’ 5%)
