### Data Flywheel
```
More Customers → More Data → Better SI →
Better Recommendations → More Conversions → More Customers
```

**Why Unbeatable**:
1. **Network Effect**: More customers = better data = better recommendations
2. **Compounding**: Data value increases exponentially over time
3. **Proprietary**: No competitor can replicate LivHana's specific customer data
4. **First Mover**: Building data moat NOW before others realize the opportunity
