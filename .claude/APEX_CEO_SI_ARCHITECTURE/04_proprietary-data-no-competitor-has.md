### Proprietary Data No Competitor Has

**1. Real Customer Purchase Data** (Lightspeed + Square)
```sql
-- Example: Which products actually work for sleep?
SELECT product_name, AVG(customer_rating), SUM(repeat_purchases)
FROM purchases
WHERE product_category = 'sleep_aid' AND customer_feedback IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY repeat_purchases DESC;

-- Insight: Products with repeat purchases = actually work
-- Google/Amazon don't have this granularity in cannabis
```

**2. Social Intelligence** (Gmail + Notion + Social Media)
```javascript
// Example: What are customers talking about RIGHT NOW?
const customerSignals = await gatherSocialIntelligence({
  sources: ['email', 'text', 'social_comments', 'notion_feedback'],
  timeframe: 'last_24_hours',
  sentiment: 'all'
});

// Real customer language: "this strain hits different for anxiety"
// vs Generic description: "calming indica for relaxation"
```

**3. Inventory + Lab Data** (Lightspeed + Compliance)
```javascript
// Example: Which products are safest + most effective?
const topProducts = await analyzeLivHanaData({
  lab_results: 'clean' (no pesticides, heavy metals),
  customer_ratings: '>4.5 stars',
  repeat_purchase_rate: '>30%',
  compliance_status: 'verified'
});

// Competitive advantage: LivHana KNOWS which products work
```

**4. Operational Intelligence** (BigQuery logs + Analytics)
```sql
-- Example: What content drives actual sales?
SELECT content_type, views, engaged_time, conversions_to_purchase
FROM content_analytics
WHERE conversion_rate > 0.05  -- 5% conversion is massive
ORDER BY conversions_to_purchase DESC;

-- Insight: HNC episode → product placement → actual sales data
-- Hollywood doesn't have this feedback loop
```
