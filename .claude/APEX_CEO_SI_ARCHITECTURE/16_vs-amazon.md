### vs Amazon

**Amazon's Weakness**: Can't sell cannabis, no customer relationship
**LivHana's Strength**: Legal cannabis sales + deep customer relationships

**Example**:
- Amazon: "Customers who bought this also bought..." (algorithmic)
- LivHana: "Customers with similar needs reported these actual outcomes..." (verified results)

**Result**: Higher trust, higher AOV, higher repeat rate
