**Scenario 1**: Conservative (20% monthly growth)
- Month 1: $80K
- Month 6: $199K
- Month 12: $743K
- Month 24: $6.9M monthly = $83M annually

**Scenario 2**: Aggressive (40% monthly growth with SI)
- Month 1: $80K
- Month 6: $537K
- Month 12: $7.2M monthly = $86M annually
- Month 18: $96M monthly = $1.15B annually ‚Üê UNICORN! ü¶Ñ
