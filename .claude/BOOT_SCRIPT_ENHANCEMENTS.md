# Claude Tier-1 Boot Script Enhancement Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Script:** `/scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh`
**Mission:** Perfect the boot script to predict and pre-resolve all potential issues

---

## Overview

The boot script has been enhanced with comprehensive predictive checks, health monitoring, and fail-safe mechanisms to eliminate race conditions and pre-resolve edge cases BEFORE they cause failures.

---

## 1. PREDICTIVE CHECKS ADDED

### 1.1 Critical Dependency Validation
**Function:** `check_critical_dependencies()`

Validates presence of ALL required CLI tools before proceeding:
- ✅ Node.js (required)
- ✅ npm (required)
- ✅ tmux (required for agent spawning)
- ✅ 1Password CLI (`op` command, required for secrets)
- ⚠️ Claude CLI (optional, warning only)

**Failure Mode:** Hard-fail if ANY critical dependency missing
**User Guidance:** Provides exact install commands for each missing tool

### 1.2 Port Conflict Pre-Resolution
**Function:** `check_port_available(port, service_name)`

Checks if ports are already in use BEFORE attempting to start services:
- Port 3005 (integration-service)
- Port 2022 (STT/Whisper)
- Port 8880 (TTS/Kokoro)

**Behavior:**
- Detects existing processes using ports
- Shows PID and process name of conflicting service
- Intelligently skips service start if port occupied
- Assumes existing service is operational (idempotent)

### 1.3 1Password Desktop App Validation
**Function:** `check_1password_desktop()`

Validates 1Password Desktop app status:
- ✅ Checks if 1Password.app process is running
- ✅ Validates CLI integration is enabled
- ⚠️ Provides guidance if integration disabled

**Edge Case Resolved:** Prevents authentication failures from missing Desktop app

### 1.4 Disk Space Monitoring
**Function:** `check_disk_space(threshold_gb)`

Monitors available disk space with configurable thresholds:
- **Critical:** < 5GB → Hard-fail with error
- **Warning:** < 10GB → Warning but continues
- **Healthy:** ≥ 10GB → Success

**Failure Prevention:** Exits BEFORE session start if disk critically low

### 1.5 Agent Health Pre-Check
**Function:** `check_agent_health(agent_name)`

Validates agent health BEFORE attempting to spawn:
- Checks tmux session exists
- Validates status file exists and is recent (<5 min)
- Confirms agent reports "active" status

**Idempotency:** Skips spawn if agent already healthy

---

## 2. RACE CONDITION ELIMINATION

### 2.1 Idempotent Agent Spawning
**Lines:** 1037-1072

**Previous Behavior:** Always spawned all 5 agents (duplicates possible)

**New Behavior:**
```bash
- Pre-check: Count healthy agents (0-5)
- Decision:
  - If 5 healthy → Skip spawn entirely
  - If 0-4 healthy → Spawn ONLY missing agents
- Individual health checks per agent before spawn
```

**Race Condition Eliminated:** Prevents duplicate agent spawns on rapid re-runs

### 2.2 Port-Aware Service Start
**Lines:** 1094-1099

**Previous Behavior:** Always attempted integration-service start

**New Behavior:**
```bash
if port 3005 already in use:
  - Skip integration-service start
  - Log: "Assuming existing service operational"
  - Continue boot sequence
else:
  - Start integration-service normally
```

**Race Condition Eliminated:** Multiple boot runs don't conflict on ports

### 2.3 Service Availability Wait
**Existing:** `wait_for_service()` function in `scripts/guards/wait_for_service.sh`

**Enhancement:** Already integrated, prevents premature health checks

---

## 3. EDGE CASES NOW HANDLED

### 3.1 1Password Authentication Failures
**Scenarios Covered:**
- ✅ Desktop app not running → Guidance to launch
- ✅ CLI integration disabled → Settings path provided
- ✅ Service account token invalid → Clear error message
- ✅ Biometric unlock timeout → User-friendly error

**Previous State:** Cryptic authentication errors
**New State:** Step-by-step resolution guidance

### 3.2 Missing Dependencies
**Scenarios Covered:**
- ✅ Node.js not found → `nvm install 20` command
- ✅ npm missing → Install guidance
- ✅ tmux not found → `brew install tmux`
- ✅ 1Password CLI missing → `brew install 1password-cli`

**Previous State:** Failed mid-execution
**New State:** Fails immediately with all fixes listed

### 3.3 Low Disk Space
**Scenarios Covered:**
- ✅ <5GB available → Hard-fail with warning
- ✅ 5-10GB available → Warning but continues
- ✅ >10GB available → Success

**Previous State:** Cursor/Claude crashes mid-session
**New State:** Prevented before session starts

### 3.4 Stale Agent Sessions
**Scenarios Covered:**
- ✅ Tmux session exists but agent unresponsive
- ✅ Status file missing
- ✅ Status file stale (>5 min old)
- ✅ Agent reports non-active status

**Previous State:** Assumed running = healthy
**New State:** Validates actual responsiveness

### 3.5 Voice Service Connectivity
**Scenarios Covered:**
- ✅ Port listening but service not responding
- ✅ Service down entirely
- ✅ Partial voice mode (one service down)

**Previous State:** Failed silently during session
**New State:** Pre-validated with connectivity tests

---

## 4. HEALTH MONITORING ADDED

### 4.1 Post-Boot Validation (Step 9)
**Lines:** 1193-1296

Comprehensive health checks AFTER boot completes:

#### Check 1: Agent Responsiveness
- Validates all 5 agents are healthy
- Reports unhealthy agents by name
- Scores: 5/5 = success, 3-4/5 = degraded, <3/5 = unstable

#### Check 2: Voice Services End-to-End
- Tests STT (Whisper) connectivity
- Tests TTS (Kokoro) connectivity
- Reports: Full/Partial/Degraded operational status

#### Check 3: Integration Service Health
- Checks port 3005 listening
- HTTP GET to `/health` endpoint
- Validates response within 3 seconds

#### Check 4: Tmux Session Count
- Expects ≥5 active sessions
- Reports actual count vs expected

#### Check 5: File System Health
- Validates critical directories exist
- Confirms write permissions
- Directories checked:
  - `tmp/agent_status`
  - `logs`
  - `.claude`
  - `tmp`

### 4.2 Health Score System
**Scale:** 0-120 points

**Scoring:**
- 20 points per healthy agent (max 100)
- 10 points for tmux sessions (≥5)
- 5 points for integration-service
- 2 points for STT service
- 3 points for TTS service

**Grades:**
- **EXCELLENT:** ≥95 points (all systems go)
- **GOOD:** 80-94 points (minor degradation)
- **FAIR:** 60-79 points (significant issues)
- **POOR:** <60 points (multiple systems down)

### 4.3 Boot Summary Display
**Lines:** 1325-1348

Real-time status dashboard showing:
- ✅/⚠️ Per-agent status
- ✅/⚠️ Voice service status (STT + TTS)
- ✅/⚠️ Integration service status
- Health score out of 120
- Boot summary checklist

---

## 5. VOICE-FIRST BOOT GREETING

### 5.1 Success Greeting
**Lines:** 1301-1322

**Trigger:** Health score ≥95 AND TTS service running

**Greeting Text:**
```
"Systems green, Jesse. All five agents active. Voice mode operational.
Integration service online. Health score: excellent, ${HEALTH_SCORE} out of 120.
Liv Hana standing by for highest state execution. Let's remind them who we are."
```

**Implementation:**
- Queued to Kokoro TTS (port 8880)
- Non-blocking (background process)
- Fails gracefully if TTS unavailable
- 5-second timeout to prevent hang

**User Experience:** Immediate audio confirmation of successful boot

---

## 6. IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY

### 6.1 Enhanced Logging
- All predictive checks logged to boot log
- Health scores logged for trend analysis
- Port conflicts logged with PID/process details

### 6.2 Better Error Messages
- Actionable guidance for every error
- Exact commands to resolve issues
- Settings paths for configuration errors

### 6.3 Graceful Degradation
- System continues if optional services fail
- Warnings instead of hard-fails for non-critical issues
- Clear indication of degraded vs failed state

---

## 7. REMAINING RISKS (CANNOT ELIMINATE)

### 7.1 Network-Dependent Failures
**Risk:** External API failures (Anthropic, OpenAI, GCP)

**Mitigation:** None (external dependency)

**Impact:** Voice mode or agent features may fail during session

**Why Can't Eliminate:** Network/API availability outside our control

### 7.2 macOS System Resource Contention
**Risk:** Other applications consuming excessive memory/CPU

**Mitigation:** Memory pressure checks, warnings

**Impact:** Cursor may still crash if system thrashing

**Why Can't Eliminate:** Cannot control other processes

### 7.3 1Password Touch ID Hardware Failures
**Risk:** Touch ID sensor malfunction

**Mitigation:** Service account token fallback documented

**Impact:** Authentication may require manual password entry

**Why Can't Eliminate:** Hardware outside our control

### 7.4 Tmux Terminal State Corruption
**Risk:** Tmux server crash or state corruption

**Mitigation:** PID file tracking, session validation

**Impact:** Agents may need manual restart

**Why Can't Eliminate:** Tmux stability not guaranteed

### 7.5 Race Condition: Simultaneous Multi-User Boots
**Risk:** Multiple users on same machine running boot simultaneously

**Mitigation:** PID files, port checks

**Impact:** First boot succeeds, subsequent fail gracefully

**Why Can't Eliminate:** No file locking implemented (intentionally simple)

---

## 8. VALIDATION RESULTS

### Syntax Check
```bash
✅ bash -n scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh
# No errors - script is syntactically valid
```

### Current System State
```
✅ All 5 agents running in tmux
✅ integration-service active on port 3005
✅ STT (Whisper) active on port 2022
✅ TTS (Kokoro) active on port 8880
✅ Voice mode listening and operational
```

### Expected Health Score on Next Boot
**Prediction:** 120/120 (EXCELLENT)
- 5 agents healthy: 100 points
- Tmux ≥5 sessions: 10 points
- integration-service: 5 points
- STT service: 2 points
- TTS service: 3 points

## 9. TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### 9.1 Test Case: Clean Boot (No Services Running)
```bash
# Stop all services
tmux kill-server
pkill -f integration-service

# Run boot
./scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh

# Expected: All services start, health score 120/120
```

### 9.2 Test Case: Idempotent Re-Run
```bash
# With all services already running
./scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh

# Expected: Detects existing, skips spawn, health score 120/120
```

### 9.3 Test Case: Missing Dependency
```bash
# Temporarily hide Node.js
export PATH="/usr/bin:/bin"

# Run boot
./scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh

# Expected: Hard-fail with install guidance
```

### 9.4 Test Case: Port Conflict
```bash
# Start rogue service on port 3005
nc -l 3005 &

# Run boot
./scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh

# Expected: Detects conflict, skips integration-service, continues
```

### 9.5 Test Case: Low Disk Space
```bash
# Simulate (edit threshold in script temporarily)
LOW_MEM_CRIT_PCT=99  # Forces critical warning

# Run boot
./scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh

# Expected: Hard-fail with disk space error
```
