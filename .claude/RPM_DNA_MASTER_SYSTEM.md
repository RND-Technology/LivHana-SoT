# üß¨ RPM DNA MASTER SYSTEM - Cascading Priority Architecture

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** October 2, 2025
**Purpose:** Universal naming convention for stack-ranking empire by value at every level

## üéØ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**RPM DNA** = Rhythmic Priority Management embedded in every file/folder name

**Core Principle:** ANY directory listing sorted by name reveals EXACT priority order across entire empire

**Format:** `AOM.COI.RPM.ACTION.CONTEXT.TIMESTAMP`

**Result:** Leadership at every level, always able to answer "What's the highest value use of my time RIGHT NOW?"

When you run `ls -1` at root level, you see:

1. `2-BIZ.HMP.001...` ‚Üê Crown jewel prep (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
2. `2-BIZ.RND.010...` ‚Üê Delivery API (MUST ship this week)
3. `2-BIZ.RND.020...` ‚Üê Leafly SEO (MUST this week)

## üîÑ WEEKLY RPM PLANNING PROCESS

### **Every Monday 9:00 AM:**

#### **Step 1: Full Funnel Value Clarification (30 min)**

1. **Dump** - Brain dump all potential tasks/projects
2. **Clarify** - What's the outcome? Why does it matter?
3. **Evaluate** - What's the ROI? (time, money, impact)
4. **Categorize** - Which AOM + COI does it belong to?
5. **Prioritize** - Assign RPM number (001-999)

#### **Step 2: Stack Rank ALL Initiatives (30 min)**

1. List all active projects/folders
2. Re-evaluate priority based on:
   - Current revenue impact
   - Strategic importance
   - Time sensitivity
   - Resource availability
   - Dependencies
3. Renumber RPM values to reflect TRUE priority
4. Rename folders/files to match new ranking

#### **Step 3: Update Timestamps (10 min)**

```bash
# Automated script renames all folders with today's date
./scripts/rpm-weekly-update.sh
```

#### **Step 4: Commit Weekly Plan (10 min)**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "üìä WEEKLY RPM: Stack rank updated $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

Top 5 Priorities This Week:
1. [Top priority from 001-range]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
4. [Fourth priority]
5. [Fifth priority]

Moved to Backlog:
- [Items moved to 800+ range]

Archived:
- [Items moved to 900+ range]
"
git push
```

#### **Step 5: Daily Review (5 min/day)**

Every morning: `ls -1` at root ‚Üí Top 3 folders = your focus today

---

## üéØ PER-EDIT PROTOCOL (Every File Change)

### **Before ANY Edit:**

1. **Ask:** Does this file/folder name reflect CURRENT priority?
2. **Check:** Is RPM number accurate given today's goals?
3. **Update:** Rename if priority has shifted

### **After ANY Edit:**

1. **Update TIMESTAMP** in folder/file name to TODAY
2. **Verify:** Does `ls -1` still show correct priority order?
3. **Commit:** Include priority context in commit message

### **Example Edit Flow:**

```bash
# BEFORE editing delivery API code:
ls -1 | grep delivery
# Shows: 2-BIZ.RND.010.DEPLOY.local-delivery-api.20251001

# Ask: Is this still priority #10?
# Answer: YES - delivering this week

# AFTER editing:
mv 2-BIZ.RND.010.DEPLOY.local-delivery-api.20251001 \
   2-BIZ.RND.010.DEPLOY.local-delivery-api.20251002

git add .
git commit -m "2-BIZ.RND.010: Add DoorDash provider integration"
```

## üéØ ANSWERING THE ULTIMATE QUESTION

**"What is the highest value use of my [time/money/resource] RIGHT NOW?"**

### **Answer in 5 Seconds:**

```bash
cd /LivHana-Trinity-Local
ls -1 | head -3
```

**Output:**

```
2-BIZ.HMP.001.PREPARE.vcs-exit-materials.20251002/
2-BIZ.RND.010.DEPLOY.local-delivery-api.20251002/
2-BIZ.RND.020.OPTIMIZE.leafly-seo-profile.20251002/
```

**Answer:** Work on one of those three folders. That's it.

**No confusion. No analysis paralysis. Just execute.**

---

## üèÜ LEADERSHIP AT EVERY LEVEL

### **How It Works:**

1. **Empire Level** - Top 3 folders at root = company priorities
2. **Department Level** - Top 3 folders in `/backend/` = engineering priorities
3. **Project Level** - Top 3 files in project = task priorities
4. **Sprint Level** - Git branch names use same convention
5. **Daily Level** - Top uncommitted file = what you're working on NOW

### **Example Cascade:**

**Empire:** `2-BIZ.RND.010.DEPLOY.local-delivery-api.20251002/`
‚Üì
**Department:** `backend/delivery-api/`
‚Üì
**Project:** Files in delivery-api:

```
001-server.js
002-database-schema.sql
003-docker-compose.yml
004-deployment-script.sh
```

‚Üì
**Task:** Currently editing `001-server.js` = highest priority file
‚Üì
**Commit:** `2-BIZ.RND.010: Add DoorDash provider to server.js`

**Every level reinforces the priority. Zero ambiguity.**

## üöÄ AUTOMATION SCRIPTS

### **1. Weekly RPM Update Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/rpm-weekly-update.sh

TODAY=$(date +%Y%m%d)

echo "üîÑ Updating RPM timestamps to $TODAY..."

find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "*-*.*.*.*.*.*.*" | while read dir; do
  # Extract components
  base=$(echo "$dir" | sed 's/\.[0-9]\{8\}$//')

  # Rename with today's date
  new_name="${base}.${TODAY}"

  if [ "$dir" != "$new_name" ]; then
    mv "$dir" "$new_name"
    echo "‚úÖ Updated: $dir ‚Üí $new_name"
  fi
done

echo "üéØ RPM timestamps updated. Run 'ls -1' to verify stack rank."
```

### **2. Priority Check Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/rpm-check.sh

echo "üéØ CURRENT EMPIRE PRIORITIES (Top 10):"
echo ""
ls -1 | grep -E "^[0-9]-" | head -10 | nl
echo ""
echo "üí° Focus on top 3 this week."
```

### **3. Git Branch Naming**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/rpm-branch.sh

# Usage: ./rpm-branch.sh "Add DoorDash integration"

PRIORITY=$(ls -1 | head -1 | cut -d'.' -f1-3)
DESC=$(echo "$1" | tr ' ' '-' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)

BRANCH="${PRIORITY}.${DESC}.${DATE}"

git checkout -b "$BRANCH"
echo "‚úÖ Created branch: $BRANCH"
