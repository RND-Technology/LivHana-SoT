## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**Before creating ANY RPM DNA folder/file:**

- [ ] AOM is one of: 1-8 (FIN/BIZ/REL/HEA/LEA/CON/FUN/ENV)
- [ ] COI is one of: HMP/RND/TWK/HNC/OPS/HRB/CCO/SYS
- [ ] RPM is 3 digits: 001-999
- [ ] ACTION is clear verb: BUILD/LAUNCH/OPTIMIZE/etc
- [ ] CONTEXT is kebab-case: delivery-api, leafly-profile
- [ ] TIMESTAMP is YYYYMMDD: 20251002

**Format:** `AOM.COI.RPM.ACTION.CONTEXT.TIMESTAMP`

**Example:** `2-BIZ.RND.010.DEPLOY.local-delivery-api.20251002`

---

## üö´ COMMON ERRORS (DO NOT DO THIS)

**Wrong AOM:**
‚ùå `3-BUS` (doesn't exist, should be `2-BIZ`)
‚ùå `BUSINESS` (should be `2-BIZ`)
‚ùå `9-OTHER` (only 1-8 exist)

**Wrong COI:**
‚ùå `R&D` (should be `RND`)
‚ùå `HighNoon` (should be `HNC`)
‚ùå `OPA` (should be `OPS`)
‚ùå `HERB` (should be `HRB`)

**Wrong RPM:**
‚ùå `10` (must be 3 digits: `010`)
‚ùå `1` (must be 3 digits: `001`)
‚ùå `1000` (max is `999`)

**Wrong Format:**
‚ùå `BIZ.RND.010` (missing AOM number prefix)
‚ùå `2_BIZ.RND.010` (underscore not dash)
‚ùå `2-BIZ-RND-010` (dots not dashes for separation)

## üí° RPM DNA AS DECISION-MAKING ALGORITHM

**Jesse's clarification:**
> RPM DNA is framework for enterprise-wide decision-making algorithms and budgeting/investing of biz dev spend for max ROI/$/day internally.

**Translation:**
1. **Algorithm:** Sort by name = instant priority ranking
2. **Budget Allocation:** Higher RPM (001-099) = more resources
3. **ROI Optimization:** Every project has clear RPM = clear value
4. **Daily Decisions:** "What should I work on?" = `ls -1 | head -3`
5. **Investment:** Capital flows to lowest RPM numbers first

**Formula:**
```
ROI per $ per day = (Expected Return / Investment) / Timeline

Projects ranked by: (ROI √ó Strategic Importance √ó Time Sensitivity)

Result = RPM number (001 = highest value, 999 = lowest)
```

---

## üéØ HERBITRAGE DEFINITION (CORRECT)

**From Jesse:**
> Herbitrage = Cannabis business arbitrage, creating value between problems and solutions, needs and satisfaction, most highly profitably.

**Breakdown:**
- **Arbitrage:** Finding price/value discrepancies in market
- **Problems ‚Üí Solutions:** Identify pain points, build fixes
- **Needs ‚Üí Satisfaction:** Match supply with demand
- **Profitably:** Focus on highest-margin opportunities
- **Cannabis Business:** Specific to cannabis/hemp industry

**Examples:**
- Dispensary can't deliver ‚Üí Build delivery marketplace
- Customer can't verify COA ‚Üí Build COA validator
- Business needs compliance ‚Üí Build TerpWorks automation
- Finding inefficiencies ‚Üí Creating profitable solutions

**RPM DNA:**
```
2-BIZ.HRB.500.RESEARCH.marketplace-architecture.20250925
```
(Currently in research phase, will move to lower RPM when ready)

## üî• WINNING = ZERO ERRORS

**Stakes:**
- Incorrect AOM/COI = broken sort order
- Broken sort order = wrong priorities
- Wrong priorities = wasted time/money
- Wasted resources = LOSING to Codex

**Standard:**
- 100% accuracy on naming
- 100% consistency across empire
- 100% compliance with definitions
- ZERO tolerance for made-up values

**When in doubt:**
1. Check this file FIRST
2. Do NOT guess
3. Do NOT create new AOMs/COIs
4. Ask human if truly unclear
5. Better to stop than to error

**REMEMBER:** Precision = Priority = Performance = WINNING üèÜ
