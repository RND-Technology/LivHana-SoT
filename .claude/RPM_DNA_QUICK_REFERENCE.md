# üß¨ RPM DNA QUICK REFERENCE
**Version:** 3.0
**Updated:** October 3, 2025
**Status:** Authoritative source of truth for RPM DNA naming (ZERO ERRORS ALLOWED)
**Purpose:** Instant lookup for the only valid RPM DNA values‚Äîzero guesswork, zero errors.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
- This file is the authoritative source of truth for all RPM DNA values.
- Use the numeric codes exactly as listed below; never invent new ones.
- Every file/dir name must follow `AOM.COI.RPM.ACTION.context.timestamp` (all lower-case context, YYYYMMDD timestamp).

| `3` | PROGRESS | Builds medium-term capability; important this quarter. |
| `4` | OPTIMIZATION | Incremental improvement; improves efficiency. |
| `5` | RESEARCH | Exploration / future upside / prototyping. |
| `6` | DELEGATED | Owned by partner or contractor (still tracked). |
| `7` | WAITING | Blocked by external dependency or approval. |
| `8` | BACKLOG | Someday/maybe backlog‚Äîno current resourcing. |

## üìê NAMING FORMAT
```
AOM.COI.RPM.ACTION.context-slug.timestamp
```
- `AOM` = single digit (1‚Äì5)
- `COI` = single digit (1‚Äì8)
- `RPM` = single digit (0‚Äì9)
- `ACTION` = single digit (0‚Äì9)
- `context-slug` = lowercase kebab case, concise
- `timestamp` = `YYYYMMDD`

**Example:**
```
1.2.1.8.local-delivery-api.20251002
```
‚Üí AOM=RND, COI=OPERATIONS, RPM=MUST, ACTION=DEPLOY, Context=`local-delivery-api`, Dated Oct‚ÄØ2‚ÄØ2025.

---

## ‚úÖ PRE-COMMIT VALIDATION CHECKLIST
- [ ] Confirm AOM code with `.claude/RPM_DNA_CORRECT_DEFINITIONS.md`.
- [ ] Confirm COI code (1‚Äì8) from the table above.
- [ ] Verify RPM and ACTION digits represent the current priority and work type.
- [ ] Context slug is unique, descriptive, and kebab-case.
- [ ] Timestamp reflects the day the artifact becomes authoritative.
- [ ] Add metadata comments to the file head:
  - `<!-- Optimized: YYYY-MM-DD -->`
  - `<!-- RPM: AOM.COI.RPM.ACTION -->`
  - `<!-- Session: [descriptor] -->`
