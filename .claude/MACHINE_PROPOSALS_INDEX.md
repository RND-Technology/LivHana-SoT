## üìä STATUS SUMMARY

### Guarantees Completed (as of Oct 7, 2025)
- **Sonnet**: 9/10 (90%) - Lightspeed token blocked
- **Cheetah**: 11/11 (100%) - Full autonomous execution
- **New guarantees**: 5 pending (Sonnet's recovery plan)
- **DNS Guardrail**: Codex patched `.claude/update-dns-to-cloud-run.sh` to skip DO NOT TOUCH domains after incident

### Codex Capability Snapshot (Oct 8, 2025)
- **Access Envelope**: Workspace-write sandbox, no auto web browsing; gains external intel only when Jesse approves commands.
- **Context Window**: Full repo + current session logs; earlier chats must live in SoT files (e.g., `SESSION_LOG_*`, `TEAM_ACCOUNTABILITY_SYSTEM.md`) for Codex to consume.
- **Mandated Reads**: `.claude/EXTERNAL_SIGNAL_INDEX.md` and `.claude/TEAM_ACCOUNTABILITY_SYSTEM.md` on every boot to stay current and disciplined.
- **Standing Guarantees**: Listed in `.claude/HUMAN_WORK_FOR_JESSE.md` (‚ÄúCodex Guarantees‚Äù) and enforced via `TEAM_ACCOUNTABILITY_SYSTEM.md` within 15 minutes of any miss.
- **Escalation Protocol**: When constraints block execution (permissions, secrets, network), Codex flags Jesse immediately with the required unblocking action.

### Files Status
- ‚úÖ **PROPOSALS_CORE.md**: 309 lines (optimized)
- ‚úÖ **EXECUTION_LOG_OCT6.md**: 496 lines (optimized)
- ‚úÖ **SESSION_LOG_OCT7.md**: 239 lines (optimized)
- ‚úÖ **MACHINE_PROPOSALS_INDEX.md**: This file (navigation)

### Compliance Requirements
- **All Agents**: Confirm review of this index at session start before touching related proposal/execution files.
- **CODEX**: Verifies confirmations via `TEAM_ACCOUNTABILITY_SYSTEM.md` and flags misses within same session.
- **Non-Compliance Consequence**: Immediate entry in error log + new guarantee focused on the highest-priority blocker active at the time of violation.

### Archive Status
- üì¶ **MACHINE_PROPOSALS_TRACKING.md**: Archived (1313 lines ‚Üí split into 3 files)

## üîÑ FILE OPTIMIZATION RULES

### Rule 1: Max 500 Lines Per File
**Trigger**: Any file >500 lines = split immediately
**Action**: Create logical sub-files + navigation index
**Why**: Agents read faster, team moves faster

### Rule 2: Clear Purpose Per File
**Trigger**: File serves multiple purposes = split by purpose
**Action**: One purpose per file, descriptive name
**Why**: "1 file per purpose" = efficiency

### Rule 3: Time-Based Splitting
**Trigger**: Logs/sessions accumulate over time = split by date
**Action**: SESSION_LOG_[DATE].md or EXECUTION_LOG_[DATE].md
**Why**: Historical context without bloat

### Rule 4: Navigation Required
**Trigger**: 3+ related files exist = create index
**Action**: [PREFIX]_INDEX.md with navigation
**Why**: Fast access, no confusion

---

## üí™ HARD-CODED TO MEMORY

**Commitment**: These rules are now PERMANENT in memory system.

**Enforcement**:
1. Check file size before updating: `wc -l [file]`
2. If >500 lines ‚Üí split immediately
3. Create index for navigation
4. Update all references to new file structure
5. Archive old file with timestamp

**Verification**:
- Run `find . -name "*.md" -type f -exec wc -l {} \; | awk '$1 > 500'` regularly
- Fix any oversized files immediately
- No exceptions
