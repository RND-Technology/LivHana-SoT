# üöÄ SESSION START CHECKLIST
**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** October 1, 2025
**Purpose:** Execute on every session start (5-7 seconds to full power)

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Auto-Execute)

### 1. Load Core Context (5 seconds)

Read these 4 files in order:

```bash
# File 1: Core persistent knowledge
cat .claude/PERSISTENT_MEMORY.md

# File 2: Latest complete status
cat reports/FINAL_STATUS_REPORT_20251001.md

# File 3: Full session history
cat .claude/72HR_CONTEXT_SYNTHESIS.md

# File 4: Current snapshot (if exists)
cat .claude/ULTIMATE_STATE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No state file yet"
```

**Expected Context After:**
- All API keys locations known
- Project structure memorized
- Service ports and commands known
- Recent achievements loaded
- Current priorities understood
- Communication style embedded

---

### 2. Verify System State (3 seconds)

```bash
# Git status
git status --short
git log --oneline -5

# Service health
curl -s http://localhost:4002/health 2>/dev/null || echo "reasoning-gateway: STOPPED"
curl -s http://localhost:3005/health 2>/dev/null || echo "integration-service: STOPPED"
curl -s http://localhost:4001/health 2>/dev/null || echo "voice-service: STOPPED"
curl -s http://localhost:5174 >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "vibe-cockpit: LIVE" || echo "vibe-cockpit: STOPPED"
redis-cli ping 2>/dev/null || echo "Redis: STOPPED"

# Code quality snapshot
npx eslint . --ext .js,.jsx 2>/dev/null | tail -2
```

**Expected Output:**
- Git: Clean, ahead/behind status, recent commits
- Services: 5/5 status (running or stopped)
- ESLint: Error/warning count

---

### 3. Report Status (1 second)

Generate concise status report:

```markdown
‚úÖ CONTEXT LOADED (7 seconds)

**Git:** [Clean/Modified], [X commits ahead], latest: [commit hash]
**Services:** [X/5 running] (reasoning-4002, integration-3005, voice-4001, frontend-5174, redis-6379)
**Code Quality:** [X errors, Y warnings]
**Production Readiness:** [score]/100

**Last Session:** [brief summary from ULTIMATE_STATE.md]
**Current Priority:** [from PERSISTENT_MEMORY.md]

What's the mission?
```

3. **What's the current priority?**
   - Answer: `.claude/PERSISTENT_MEMORY.md` section "CURRENT PRIORITIES"
   - Action: Focus on Priority 1 unless told otherwise

4. **What was I working on last session?**
   - Answer: `.claude/ULTIMATE_STATE.md` or `git log -1`
   - Action: Resume from last checkpoint

5. **Are there any known blockers?**

## üîç RECOVERY SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Fresh Session, All Services Stopped

**Status:**
- Git: Clean
- Services: 0/5 running
- Last session: Unknown

**Action:**
1. Load context (7 seconds)

4. If yes: Execute service startup sequence

### Scenario 2: Mid-Task Recovery

**Status:**
- Git: Modified files present
- Services: May be running
- Last session: Incomplete work

**Action:**
1. Load context (7 seconds)
2. Read ULTIMATE_STATE.md for last checkpoint

5. If yes: Continue from last known good state

### Scenario 3: Post-Cursor-Crash Recovery

**Status:**
- Git: Possibly dirty
- Services: Unknown state
- Last session: Interrupted

**Action:**
1. Load context (7 seconds)
2. Check service health (may still be running)
3. Check git status for uncommitted work

5. Report: "Recovered from crash. Last commit: [message]. Services: [status]. Resume?"

### Scenario 4: Post-Deployment Session

**Status:**
- Git: Clean (just pushed)
- Services: Should be running

## üö® RED FLAGS (Stop and Report)

If you see any of these, report immediately:

- ‚ùå **Git has conflicts** - Don't auto-resolve
- ‚ùå **Services won't start** - Check logs
- ‚ùå **ESLint >100 errors** - Something is very wrong
- ‚ùå **Tests failing** - Don't continue without understanding why
- ‚ùå **Redis not responding** - Critical dependency down
- ‚ùå **Secrets missing** - Can't access 1Password items
- ‚ùå **Context files missing** - PERSISTENT_MEMORY.md not found

**Report Format:**
```markdown
üö® RED FLAG DETECTED

**Issue:** [What's wrong]
**Impact:** [How this blocks work]
**Checked:** [What diagnostics were run]
**Next:** [What's needed to resolve]
```

## üí° OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### Faster Context Load

Instead of reading 4 full files, read key sections:

```bash
# Quick context extraction
grep -A 5 "CURRENT PRIORITIES" .claude/PERSISTENT_MEMORY.md
tail -20 reports/FINAL_STATUS_REPORT_20251001.md
grep -A 10 "CURRENT STATUS" .claude/ULTIMATE_STATE.md
```

**Time:** 7 seconds ‚Üí 3 seconds

### Parallel Verification

Run health checks and git checks simultaneously:

```bash
# Parallel execution
(curl -s http://localhost:4002/health &);
(curl -s http://localhost:3005/health &);
(git status --short &);
wait
```

**Time:** 3 seconds ‚Üí 1 second

### Cache Recent Status

If ULTIMATE_STATE.md was updated <5 minutes ago, trust it:

```bash
# Check file age
if [ $(( $(date +%s) - $(stat -f %m .claude/ULTIMATE_STATE.md) )) -lt 300 ]; then
  echo "Using cached state (< 5 minutes old)"
  cat .claude/ULTIMATE_STATE.md
fi
```

**Time:** 7 seconds ‚Üí <1 second (when cached)

**Time from session start ‚Üí full context:** 7 seconds
**Time from full context ‚Üí ready for orders:** 3 seconds
**Total boot time:** 10 seconds

**Compare to:**
- Old way (no memory): 15+ minutes explaining everything
- Efficiency gain: 99.3%
