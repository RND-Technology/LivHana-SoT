## üéØ DECISION TREE: Should I Commit?

### YES - Commit Now:
- ‚úÖ Feature complete and tested
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ ESLint clean
- ‚úÖ Logical checkpoint reached
- ‚úÖ Refactor complete
- ‚úÖ Bug fixed and verified
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated

### MAYBE - Evaluate:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Feature partially complete but coherent
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tests passing but more tests needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ESLint clean but warnings present
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental change that works

**Decision:** Commit with clear message about partial state

### NO - Don't Commit Yet:
- ‚ùå Code doesn't compile
- ‚ùå Tests failing
- ‚ùå ESLint errors present
- ‚ùå Feature half-implemented
- ‚ùå Breaking changes not documented
- ‚ùå Commented-out code everywhere

**Action:** Either finish or stash changes, document in ULTIMATE_STATE.md

---

## üîÑ INCOMPLETE WORK PROTOCOL

If ending session with incomplete work:

### 1. Create Checkpoint

```bash
# Option A: Commit partial work with clear marker
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: [Task] - [What's done] - [What's left]

Status: X% complete
Next: [Specific next step]
Files: [List of files in progress]

‚ö†Ô∏è NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION - IN PROGRESS"

# Option B: Stash with descriptive message
git stash push -m "WIP: [Task] - [What's done] - [What's left]"
```

### 2. Document in ULTIMATE_STATE.md

```markdown
## ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS: [Task Name]

**Status:** X% complete

**What's Done:**
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

**What's Left:**
- [Item 1] - [ETA: X minutes]
- [Item 2] - [ETA: Y minutes]

**Next Step (EXACT):**
[Specific command or action to resume]

**Files Modified:**
- /path/to/file1.js - [What changed]
- /path/to/file2.js - [What changed]

**Dependencies:**
- [None / List]

**Blocker:**
- [None / Description]

**Resume Command:**
```bash
# [Exact command to continue work]
```
```

### 3. Create CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md

Save detailed recovery info:

```markdown
# üîÑ CURRENT SESSION STATE
**Last Updated:** [Timestamp]
**Session:** [In Progress / Interrupted]

---

## üéØ WHAT I WAS DOING

**Task:** [Exact task description]

**Approach:** [How I was solving it]

**Progress:** [What's completed]

**Next Step:** [EXACT next action]

---

## üìÅ FILES IN PROGRESS

1. /path/to/file1.js
   - Lines: [X-Y]
   - Change: [What was being changed]
   - Status: [Incomplete / Needs testing / etc]

2. /path/to/file2.js
   - Lines: [X-Y]
   - Change: [What was being changed]
   - Status: [Incomplete / Needs testing / etc]

---

## üß† CONTEXT

**Why:** [Why this task matters]

**Decision Made:** [Key decisions during work]

**Tried:** [Approaches that failed]

**Working:** [Approach that's working]

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è RESUME INSTRUCTIONS

```bash
# Step 1: [Command]
# Step 2: [Command]
# Step 3: [Command]
```

**Expected Result:** [What should happen]

---

**Auto-Resume:** [Yes/No]
**Estimated Completion:** [X minutes remaining]
```

---

## üö® EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN PROTOCOL

If session ends unexpectedly (Cursor crash, computer shutdown):

### Auto-Recovery Will Need:

1. **ULTIMATE_STATE.md** (last checkpoint)
2. **Git commit messages** (what was done)
3. **Uncommitted files** (git diff)
4. **Service logs** (what was running)
5. **CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md** (exact state)

### Prevention:

- Commit frequently (every 15-30 minutes)
- Update ULTIMATE_STATE.md on major actions
- Save CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md when starting risky work
- Keep services running (easier recovery)
