- Codebase exploration
- Context building for Liv
- Feeds both Liv and Klein

### 3. **Artifacts Agent** (Layer 1.3)
- Documentation generation
- Deliverable creation
- Knowledge base maintenance
- Public-facing content

### 4. **Execution Monitor** (execmon)
- Code execution tracking
- Deployment monitoring
- Build/test validation
- Performance telemetry

## M4 Mac Optimization

### Performance Profile
- **Chip:** Apple Silicon M4 (8-core CPU, 10-core GPU)
- **RAM:** 16GB unified memory
- **Storage:** 512GB SSD
- **OS:** macOS Sonoma+

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Native ARM64 Compilation**
   - All Node.js services compiled for ARM
   - No Rosetta translation overhead
   - Docker containers using ARM base images

2. **Unified Memory Architecture**
   - Redis runs on host (not containerized)
   - Shared memory between services
   - Minimal network latency

3. **Concurrent Service Execution**
   - Docker Compose network_mode: host
   - 5 services run simultaneously
   - Real-time WebSocket coordination

4. **Autoscaling Intelligence**
   - BullMQ worker pool (1-6 workers)
   - Dynamic scaling based on queue depth
   - CPU/memory efficient scaling

---

## Klein Integration Plan

### Integration Points

#### 1. **Orchestration Hub Registration**
```typescript
// Klein registers as monitored agent
POST /api/orchestration/agents/klein/status
{
  "status": "running",
  "port": 5001,
  "capabilities": ["reasoning", "analysis", "generation"]
}
```

#### 2. **Reasoning Pipeline**
```
Voice Input → Liv (Triage) → Klein (Reasoning) → Liv (Synthesis) → Voice Output
```

#### 3. **Real-Time Coordination**
- Klein receives jobs via BullMQ
- Reports status to orchestration service
- Liv monitors Klein health/performance
- Voice commands control Klein operations

### Klein Capabilities
- **Parallel Reasoning:** Run alongside Liv's orchestration
- **ChatGPT Replacement:** Drop-in replacement for OpenAI calls
- **Specialized Processing:** Handle compute-heavy reasoning tasks
- **Load Distribution:** Balance work between Liv and Klein

---

## Visualization System

### Real-Time Dashboard (Port 4010)

```javascript
// WebSocket Connection
ws://localhost:4010/ws

// Live Updates
- Agent status (5 agents + Klein)
- Queue metrics (waiting/active/failed jobs)
- Service health (voice/reasoning/orchestration)
- Voice command history
- System metrics (CPU/memory/uptime)
```

### Dashboard Components
1. **Agent Grid:** Status of all 6 agents (5 foundation + Klein)
2. **Queue Monitor:** Real-time job counts, worker pool size
3. **Service Health:** Response times, uptime, error rates
4. **Voice History:** Last 100 commands with status
5. **System Vitals:** Load average, memory usage, network

### Voice Visualization
- Voice commands appear in real-time
- Color-coded status (green=accepted, red=failed, yellow=queued)
- Playback history for debugging
- Telemetry data for optimization

## Real-World Demo Sequence

### Demo 1: Voice-Controlled Autoscaling
**Duration:** 2 minutes
**Narrative:** "Watch Liv respond to voice commands to scale the reasoning engine"

1. **Setup:** Dashboard visible, queue at steady state (2 workers)
2. **Command:** "Liv, scale up workers to handle more load"
3. **Action:** Autoscaler increases to 4 workers
4. **Visualization:** Dashboard shows worker count rising, queue draining faster
5. **Result:** "This is real-time orchestration, not pre-recorded"

### Demo 2: Dual-AI Reasoning
**Duration:** 3 minutes
**Narrative:** "Klein and Liv work together on complex problems"

1. **Setup:** Submit reasoning task via voice
2. **Liv Action:** Triages task, determines Klein should handle
3. **Klein Action:** Processes complex reasoning job
4. **Coordination:** Orchestration service shows both agents active
5. **Synthesis:** Liv receives Klein's output, synthesizes final answer
6. **Output:** Voice response with attribution ("Klein analyzed... I synthesized...")

### Demo 3: Five-Tool Continuous Loop
**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Narrative:** "Behind every response, five agents work continuously"

1. **Show Agent Grid:** All 5 agents running
2. **Trigger Planning:** "Liv, what's on my plate this week?"
3. **Show Research:** Research agent pulls RPM Weekly Plan
4. **Show Artifacts:** Artifacts agent formats response
5. **Show ExecMon:** Execution monitor tracks completion
6. **Show QA:** QA agent validates output quality
7. **Voice Output:** Liv delivers synthesized response
