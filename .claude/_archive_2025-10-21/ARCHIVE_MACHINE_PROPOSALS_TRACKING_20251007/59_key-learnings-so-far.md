### **KEY LEARNINGS SO FAR:**

**What Worked**:
- ✅ 1Password CLI integration (`op item get`) for secure credential retrieval
- ✅ Rapid bug identification and fixes (tts.js dialogue iteration)
- ✅ Production-ready code already existed for Veriff
- ✅ HNC automation system was 95% complete, just needed deployment
- ✅ Parallel execution strategy (assess → plan → execute fastest wins first)

**What's Blocked**:
- ❌ Lightspeed requires Personal Token (manual generation in admin panel)
- ⚠️ Ecwid fix script ready but needs manual browser trigger
- ⚠️ Some guarantees inherently require human verification (checkout flow testing)

**What I'm Learning**:
- 100% automation is HARD when APIs require OAuth/manual token generation
- Browser automation (Playwright) is powerful but needs manual triggers for security-sensitive operations
- Existing R&D work is extremely valuable - integration-service had production-ready Veriff code
- Speed comes from identifying what CAN be done immediately vs what's blocked

**Time Spent**: ~30 minutes from commitment to 3 guarantees complete

**Remaining Work**: 7 guarantees (some blocked, need Jesse's input on approach)
