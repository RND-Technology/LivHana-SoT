### Replit Agent (Sonnet 4.5 in Replit - Proposed)

**Replit's Claims**:
- Deploy all Claude Code & Cheetah work
- VIP Cockpit in 7 days
- $100K revenue dashboard in 21 days
- Full E2E production in 30 days

**REALITY CHECK**:
- ‚ùå **100% of claimed work is ALREADY DEPLOYED**
- ‚ùå **Replit is separate environment** (not our production stack)
- ‚ùå **Opportunity cost**: 30 days to re-do vs. 7 days for NEW work

**ACTUAL Potential Value** (IF Redefined):
1. ‚úÖ **Prototyping**: Test features fast in Replit first
2. ‚úÖ **Staging**: Safe environment for experiments
3. ‚úÖ **Demos**: Show Jesse concepts before production
4. ‚úÖ **A/B Testing**: Quick validation of ideas

**Cost**: $0-20/month platform
**Timeline**: 5 days to operational
**Probability**: 70% (good fit for Replit strengths)
**Value IF Focused on Prototyping**: $10K-20K/year

**VERDICT**: üî∂ **CONDITIONAL ACCEPT** - ONLY as prototyping, NOT as production
