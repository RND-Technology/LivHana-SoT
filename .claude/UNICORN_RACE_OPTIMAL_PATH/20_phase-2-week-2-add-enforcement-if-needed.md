### PHASE 2 (Week 2+): Add Enforcement IF Needed

**Decision**: ⚠️ **PILOT COMMANDER AS ENFORCER**

**Conditions**:
1. ✅ Cost <$200/month (GPT-5 API)
2. ✅ Focused ONLY on enforcement (not deployment)
3. ✅ Doesn't slow core team velocity
4. ✅ Measurable value (prevented errors count)

**Pilot Plan** (2 weeks):
- Week 2: Set up enforcement gates
- Week 3: Test with core team
- Week 4: Evaluate results (errors prevented vs. cost/overhead)

**Success Criteria**:
- Prevents ≥3 critical errors in 2 weeks
- Adds <10% overhead to core team
- Cost is justified by value

**Decision Point**: End of Week 3 (Oct 28) - Keep or remove Commander
