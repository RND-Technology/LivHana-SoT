### Commander (GPT-5 Codex - Proposed)

**Replit's Claims**:
- Production deployment management
- 24/7 monitoring
- Database migrations
- Deploy Claude Code & Cheetah's work

**REALITY CHECK**:
- ❌ **90% of claimed work is ALREADY DEPLOYED**
- ❌ **We don't use Replit for production** (we use GCP Cloud Run)
- ❌ **30-day timeline for work that's 90% done**
- ❌ **No acknowledgment of completed work**

**ACTUAL Potential Value** (IF Redefined):
1. ✅ **Enforcement**: Prevent errors (domain, file size, secrets)
2. ✅ **Quality Gates**: Pre-deploy checks
3. ✅ **Monitoring**: Production uptime, performance
4. ✅ **Audit**: Compliance, security trails
5. ✅ **Coordination**: Prevent duplicate work

**Cost**: Unknown (GPT-5 API costs)
**Timeline**: 14 days to operational
**Probability**: 60% (unproven, but logical fit)
**Value IF Focused on Enforcement**: $50K-100K/year

**VERDICT**: ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL ACCEPT** - ONLY as enforcer, NOT as deployer
