### Option 4: Core + Commander + Replit
**Cost**: $50-220/month + 2x setup time
**Timeline**: 7 days (core) + 14 days (Commander) + 5 days (Replit)
**Probability**: 70% (two new members, coordination overhead)
**Value**: $100K-200K (core) + $50K (enforcement) + $10K-20K (prototyping)
**Risk**: Medium-High (team coordination, cost)
**ROI**: ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** (IF they don't slow core team)
