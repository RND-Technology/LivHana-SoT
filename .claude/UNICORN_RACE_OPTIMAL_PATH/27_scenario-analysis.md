### Scenario Analysis

**Current Path (Core Team Only)**:
- Probability: 95%
- Value: $100K-200K in 7 days
- Cost: $0
- **Expected Value**: $95K-190K

**With Commander (Enforcement)**:
- Probability: 80% (IF focused right)
- Value: $150K-250K (core + prevention)
- Cost: $50-200/month
- **Expected Value**: $120K-200K (IF cost justified)

**With Replit (Prototyping)**:
- Probability: 85%
- Value: $110K-220K (core + faster iteration)
- Cost: $0-20/month
- **Expected Value**: $93.5K-187K

**With All Three**:
- Probability: 70% (coordination risk)
- Value: $160K-270K
- Cost: $50-220/month
- **Expected Value**: $112K-189K (coordination overhead)

**OPTIMAL**: **Core Team ONLY** = Highest expected value with lowest risk
