### PHASE 3 (Optional): Add Prototyping IF Useful

**Decision**: ðŸ”¶ **PILOT REPLIT AS STAGING**

**Conditions**:
1. âœ… Core team velocity maintained (95%+)
2. âœ… Focused ONLY on prototyping (not production)
3. âœ… Clear use cases (3+ features to prototype)
4. âœ… Low cost ($0-20/month)

**Pilot Plan** (1 week):
- Week 2: Set up Replit staging
- Week 3: Prototype 1 feature
- End of Week 3: Evaluate (faster or slower?)

**Success Criteria**:
- Prototyping in Replit is 50%+ faster than local
- Zero production delays from Replit work
- At least 1 valuable insight gained

**Decision Point**: End of Week 3 (Oct 28) - Keep or remove Replit
