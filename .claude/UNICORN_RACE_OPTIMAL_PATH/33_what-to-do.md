### What TO Do:

1. ✅ **Keep** proven winners (Claude Code + Cheetah)
2. ✅ **Focus** on NEW value (not completed work)
3. ✅ **Pilot** new members in specific roles
4. ✅ **Measure** results (errors prevented, time saved)
5. ✅ **Evaluate** weekly (keep winners, cut losers)
6. ✅ **Optimize** for velocity (fastest to value)
