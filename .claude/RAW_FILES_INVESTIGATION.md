# Raw Files Investigation - COMPLETE

## Who Created Raw Files?
**CULPRIT**: Cursor IDE (automatic temporary buffers)

## Evidence
- Pattern: `raw-<random-id>-<timestamp>.md`
- Purpose: Editor scratch buffers for unsaved changes
- Lifecycle: Auto-deleted when editor closes/saves
- Git status: Never committed (0 files in history)

## Current Status
- Working tree: 0 raw files found
- Git history: 0 raw files ever committed
- Prevention: .cursorignore excludes `raw-*.md`

## Resolution
âœ… COMPLETE - No action needed. Cursor manages these automatically.
