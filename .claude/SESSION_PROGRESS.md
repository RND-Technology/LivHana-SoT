## 2025-10-21 18:57:33 CDT — Three-Flag Deployment + Revenue Tracking Complete

**Mission Accomplished:**
1. ✅ Three-flag deployment system built and ready
2. ✅ Revenue tracking monitor operational
3. ✅ RPM competition framework integrated
4. ✅ All deployment artifacts generated

**Deployment Artifacts:**
- Custom GPT: $300/day target (1-2 hours to deploy)
- Slack Bot: $500/day target (4-6 hours to deploy)
- Replit PWA: $400/day target (3-5 hours to deploy)
- **Total: $1,200/day = $36K/month = $432K/year**

**Revenue Tracking:**
- Real-time dashboard: `python3 scripts/revenue_tracking_monitor.py dashboard`
- Event logging: `python3 scripts/revenue_tracking_monitor.py log <flag> <event> <amount>`
- RPM integration: Automatic sync with competition framework

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/revenue_tracking_monitor.py` (revenue monitor)
- `.claude/quick_reference/REVENUE_TRACKING_USAGE.md` (usage guide)
- `.claude/flag_deployments/` (deployment specs for all three flags)
- `.claude/SESSION_STATUS_2025-10-21_EVENING.md` (detailed status)

**Next Action:**
1. Choose which flag to deploy first (Custom GPT recommended - fastest)
2. Execute deployment following artifact specs
3. Start logging revenue events
4. Monitor $1,200/day target performance
