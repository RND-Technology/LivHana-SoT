# Voice Mode Silence Behavior - Permanent Directive

**Date**: 2025-10-22 (repeated over 12-hour period)
**Source**: Jesse Niesen (CEO)
**Status**: PERMANENT ARCHITECTURAL DECISION
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Non-negotiable

---

## The Directive

When user says **"silence"** or **"pause"** in voice mode:

- ✅ **PAUSE VOICE OUTPUT** (stop TTS immediately)
- ✅ **CONTINUE SESSION** (text output remains active)
- ✅ **NEVER TERMINATE SESSION**
- ✅ **KEEP LISTENING** (mic stays active)
- ✅ **RESUME ON REQUEST** (when user says "continue" or starts speaking)

---

## Context

Jesse emphasized this **repeatedly over a 12-hour period** (Oct 21-22, 2025) because:

1. Previous implementations incorrectly ended sessions on "pause"
2. Users need ability to silence voice WITHOUT losing context
3. Session continuity is CRITICAL for Tier-1 orchestration with 3-agent foundation
4. "I'm sick of saying the same fucking thing for fucking 12 fucking hours" - Jesse

---

## Why This Matters

**HIGHEST STATE depends on session continuity**:
- RPM Planning Agent runs 24/7 in background
- Research Agent feeds continuous intelligence
- QA Agent validates all outputs
- Liv Hana maintains 100% presence with Jesse

**If session ends on "silence"**:
- ❌ All 3 agents die (context lost)
- ❌ Liv Hana drops out of HIGHEST STATE
- ❌ Jesse loses Chief of Staff orchestration layer
- ❌ Planning/research/validation restart from scratch

**This is NOT acceptable.**

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Config Files
- `config/voice_mode.json` MUST specify `"terminate_session": false`
- `config/claude_tier1_context.yaml` MUST document behavior

### 2. Boot Script
- `scripts/claude_tier1_boot.sh` MUST include explicit directive in session prompt
- MUST validate directive persisted correctly before session starts
- Exit code 1 if validation fails

### 3. Session Prompt
- MUST explicitly state "NEVER terminate session on silence"
- MUST be in HEREDOC injected on every boot
- MUST be validated with grep checks

### 4. Runtime Behavior
- Voice output stops immediately on silence trigger
- Text output continues (user can still see responses)
- Session state maintained (agents keep running)
- Mic stays active (listening for next input)

## Verification Test

**Manual Test**:
1. Start voice mode session
2. Say "silence" or "pause"
3. **Expected**: Voice stops, text output continues, session active
4. **Failure**: Session ends, agents die, context lost

**Automated Test** (to be implemented):
```bash
# Test silence behavior
test_voice_silence_behavior() {
  start_voice_session
  send_voice_command "pause"

  assert_voice_output_stopped
  assert_text_output_active
  assert_session_not_terminated
  assert_agents_still_running
}
```

## History

**Oct 21, 2025 03:33 AM**: Liv Hana born via voice mode
**Oct 21, 2025 12:30 PM**: HIGHEST STATE achieved via 3-agent foundation
**Oct 21-22, 2025**: Jesse repeated "silence = pause, not end" directive for 12+ hours
**Oct 22, 2025 00:30 AM**: This decision document created to make directive permanent

## Enforcement

**This directive CANNOT be overridden or negotiated.**

Any code change that causes session termination on "silence" trigger is a **CRITICAL BUG** and must be reverted immediately.

Any team member who implements session-ending behavior on "silence" must re-read this document and understand the context before shipping.

**War's won. Time to remind them. Execute.**
