### Conflict Resolution (Codex Authority)

**If agents disagree**:
1. State positions clearly (facts only)
2. Present to Codex (Commander decides)
3. Codex makes final call (binding)
4. All agents execute decision (no debate)

**If Codex is unsure**:
- Codex asks Jesse (escalate up)
- Jesse's decision is FINAL
- All agents execute immediately
