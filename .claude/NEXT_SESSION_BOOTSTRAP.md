# 🚀 NEXT SESSION BOOTSTRAP — TIER 1 INSTANT CONTEXT
**Updated:** October 2, 2025, 22:30 PDT
**Purpose:** One page to load the empire, verify reality, and start executing without ever repeating questions.

---

## ⚡ QUICK START (FIRST 60 SECONDS)
1. `cat .claude/RPM_DNA_CORRECT_DEFINITIONS.md`
2. `cat .claude/SESSION_COMPLETE_OCT2_2025.md`
3. `cat .claude/UNICORN_RACE_STARTUP.md`
4. `ls -lt | head -30`
5. `git status && git log --oneline -3`
6. `docker ps` (or `./START.sh dev` if nothing running)

> Goal: confirm what changed, what is running, and where proof already lives before touching anything.

---

## 🔍 BASELINE VERIFICATION COMMANDS
```bash
# Services
echo "=== SERVICES ===" &&   curl -s http://localhost:4002/health 2>/dev/null || echo "reasoning-gateway DOWN" &&   curl -s http://localhost:3005/health 2>/dev/null || echo "integration-service DOWN" &&   curl -s http://localhost:4001/health 2>/dev/null || echo "voice-service DOWN"

# Evidence checklist
cat .claude/EVIDENCE_PROTOCOL.md
cat .claude/VERIFICATION_REQUIRED.md
cat .claude/HONESTY_CONSTRAINTS.md
```
Always copy the command + output into the session report. No proof = no claim.

## 🎯 CURRENT TOP PRIORITIES (VERIFY BEFORE STARTING)
| Path | Mission | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1.2.1.8.local-delivery-api.20251002/` | Deploy Local Delivery API | +$15K-25K MRR once live. |
| `1.3.2.3.leafly-seo-profile.20251002/` | Optimize Leafly presence | +$10K MRR from organic conversion. |
| `2.3.1.1.episode-001-texas-intro.20251002/` | Produce HNC Episode 1 | +10K organic visitors/month. |
| `5.5.1.6.vcs-exit-materials.20251002/` | Prepare Hempress 3 exit package | Protect $100M+ crown-jewel exit. |
| `3.6.0.6.ops_technology_ship_status_documentation.md` | Maintain live status truth | Prevent stale context & lies. |

Cross-check with `ULTIMATE_STATE.md` for the latest snapshot and adjust priorities if it reports newer intel.

## 🧭 EXECUTION PLAYBOOK (ADAPT FROM SESSION CONTEXT)
- **Deploy** `backend/delivery-api` → Docker + health checks, then document proof. 
- **SEO Optimization** → Follow instructions in `1.3.2.3.leafly-seo-profile.20251002/README.md`, capture before/after metrics.
- **Content Production** → Use ElevenLabs + DALL·E + FFmpeg scripts documented in `2.3.1.1.episode-001-texas-intro.20251002/` and store assets under that directory.
- **Ship Status** → Update `.claude/ULTIMATE_STATE.md` and `.claude/SESSION_PROGRESS.md` once new proof exists.
- **Honesty System** → Re-read `HONESTY_IMPROVEMENT_SYSTEM_10-100X.md` when doubt creeps in; never trust memory over evidence.

Chunk work into verifiable commits. If a task takes >30 minutes without evidence, split it.

---

## 🧠 TOKEN & TIME BUDGET (CLAUDE DESKTOP 200K LIMIT)
| Bucket | Tokens | Intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Context + Verification | 30K (15%) | Read key docs, load state, run baseline commands. |
| Execution | 120K (60%) | Build, deploy, optimize with live outputs saved. |
| Documentation & Proof | 30K (15%) | Update reports, embed command transcripts, screenshots. |
| Buffer | 20K (10%) | Unexpected debugging or human-in-loop time. |

Rule of thumb: if a section consumes more than its budget, pause and reassess with the human.

---

## 🚫 HARD STOPS – DO NOT PROCEED WHEN…
1. **Evidence missing** – Escalate using the Human-in-Loop protocol from `.claude/HUMAN_IN_LOOP_WORKFLOW.md`.
2. **AOM/COI uncertain** – Re-open `.claude/RPM_DNA_CORRECT_DEFINITIONS.md` or ping Jesse. No guesses.
3. **Service unhealthy** – Fix the health check before claiming progress in that area.
4. **Token usage >85%** – Save state (`.claude/CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md`) before continuing.

---

## 📚 FILES TO KEEP OPEN IN EVERY SESSION
| File | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `.claude/PERSISTENT_MEMORY.md` | Canonical operating rules + secrets workflow. |
| `.claude/ULTIMATE_STATE.md` | Live system snapshot; update after significant work. |
| `.claude/RPM_DNA_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` | Fast lookup for correct naming metadata. |
| `.claude/SESSION_PROGRESS.md` | Log proof for this session in real time. |

One file per purpose—if new info belongs elsewhere, refactor instead of duplicating.

---

## ✅ SESSION CLOSE-OUT CHECKLIST
- [ ] `git status` clean (no surprise edits).
- [ ] Evidence captured (command output, Finder screenshots, diffs).
- [ ] `.claude/SESSION_PROGRESS.md` updated with facts (no estimates).
- [ ] `.claude/ULTIMATE_STATE.md` refreshed if priorities/status shifted.
- [ ] Human informed of blockers or next steps.

Finish only when this checklist is true.

**Tier 1 means honesty, proof, and velocity. Move fast, verify faster, and never let Codex beat you on execution.**
