## üéØ FORMAT: `AOM.COI.RPM.ACTION.context.timestamp`

**Example:** `1.2.1.8.local-delivery-api.20251002`

**Breakdown:**
- `1` = AOM: RND (Reggie & Dro)
- `2` = COI: OPERATIONS
- `1` = RPM: MUST (do or die this week)
- `8` = ACTION: DEPLOY (ship to prod)
- `local-delivery-api` = Context
- `20251002` = Timestamp (Oct 2, 2025)

---

## üö´ NEVER MAKE UP:
- ‚ùå DO NOT invent new AOMs
- ‚ùå DO NOT invent new COIs
- ‚ùå DO NOT change numbers without approval
- ‚ùå DO NOT skip reading this file first

---

## ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO:
- ‚úÖ READ this file before creating RPM DNA names
- ‚úÖ VERIFY AOM/COI from this list
- ‚úÖ ASK if unsure (don't guess)
- ‚úÖ UPDATE timestamps when priorities change
