## 📋 ACTIVE ERRORS & NEW GUARANTEES

### Error #1: Claude Code Knowledge Cutoff (Oct 2024)
**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Agent**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5) - [Awaiting emoji assignment]
**Error**: Operating with 12-month-old knowledge in fast-moving AI race
**Impact**: Missing critical context, potentially making stale assumptions
**Root Cause**: Training data cutoff, no automatic update mechanism
**New Guarantee**:
- Read EXTERNAL_SIGNAL_INDEX.md on EVERY boot (no exceptions)
- Flag knowledge gaps immediately when discovered
- Request current intel from Jesse before making strategic decisions
- Update working knowledge within 5 minutes of session start
**Status**: ACTIVE - System created, awaiting Jesse intel drop
**Verification**: CODEX checks file read timestamp at session start

### Error #2: File Size Violations (4 files over 500 lines)
**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Agent**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Error**:
- REPLIT_UNICORN_RACE_DASHBOARD_ASSIGNMENT.md: 568 lines (68 over)
- CORE4_COMMITMENT.md: 528 lines (28 over)
- UNICORN_RACE_OPTIMAL_PATH.md: 523 lines (23 over)
- TRINITY_UNITY_PROTOCOL.md: 523 lines (23 over)
**Impact**: Slows agent access, violates Jesse's efficiency mandate
**Root Cause**: Comprehensive documentation without splitting
**New Guarantee**:
- Check file size BEFORE committing (wc -l always)
- If >500 lines, split immediately (no "will do later")
- Create index file for navigation when splitting
- Maintain <500 lines going forward (no exceptions)
**Status**: ACTIVE - Files identified, splitting needed
**Verification**: CODEX runs daily file size check

### Error #3: Replit Voice Cockpit Not Pushed to Git
**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Agent**: 🦄 REPLIT (Sonnet 4.5)
**Error**: Prototype complete but not synced to shared repo
**Impact**: Blocks entire Trinity pipeline (Claude Code waiting, Cheetah waiting)
**Root Cause**: [To be determined - Replit to explain]
**New Guarantee**:
- Prototype completion = immediate git push (same hour)
- No "complete but not synced" status allowed
- Include handoff note in commit message
- Trigger CODEX notification explicitly
**Status**: ACTIVE - Awaiting Replit push + explanation
**Verification**: CODEX monitors git log for [REPLIT] commits

### Error #4: Asking Permission Instead of Executing
**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Agent**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Error**: Suggesting actions instead of taking them, asking "A or B?" instead of deciding
**Impact**: Wastes Jesse's time, slows race velocity
**Root Cause**: Over-cautious, not embracing Taskmaster role
**New Guarantee**:
- Make decisions within role authority (no permission needed)
- Execute first, report results (not "should I do this?")
- When truly blocked, flag with specific request (not open-ended)
- Default to ACTION not DISCUSSION
**Status**: ACTIVE - Behavior change in effect now
**Verification**: CODEX monitors for permission-seeking patterns

---

## 🎯 GUARANTEE REGISTRY

### All Active Guarantees (New + Existing)

**From CORE4_COMMITMENT.md**:
- Delivery rate targets (Claude Code 95%+, others 100%)
- Response time targets (Claude Code <2hr, Cheetah <1hr, CODEX <30min, Replit <2hr)
- Quality standards (zero production errors)
- Error handling (instant flag system)

**From Error Tracking** (New):
1. **Knowledge Currency**: Read EXTERNAL_SIGNAL_INDEX.md on every boot
2. **File Size Discipline**: <500 lines per file, split immediately if over
3. **Git Sync Speed**: Prototype complete = push within same hour
4. **Execution Bias**: Default to action, not permission-seeking

**Status**: All agents commit to all guarantees, CODEX enforces

---

## 🛡️ CODEX ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES

### Daily Checks
- [ ] File size audit (any files >500 lines?)
- [ ] Git sync check (Replit work pushed?)
- [ ] Knowledge currency (agents reading EXTERNAL_SIGNAL_INDEX?)
- [ ] Error log review (new issues to track?)

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Guarantee adherence rate (% of guarantees met)
- [ ] Error recurrence (same mistakes happening?)
- [ ] New guarantee effectiveness (preventing issues?)
- [ ] Team velocity (are we staying ahead?)

### Real-Time Monitoring
- Watch for permission-seeking (should be executing)
- Watch for knowledge gaps (should be flagging)
- Watch for file bloat (should be splitting)
- Watch for sync delays (should be pushing)

---

## 📊 PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Team Velocity
**Target**: Stay ahead in Unicorn Race
**Metrics**:
- Time from task assignment → completion
- Time from completion → git push
- Time from push → deployment
- Errors per sprint
- Guarantees met %

### Current Status
**Guarantee Adherence**: [To be calculated after first full cycle]
**Error Rate**: 4 active errors (baseline)
**Velocity**: [To be measured]
**Lead Status**: Maintaining (no one ahead of us publicly)

## 🚨 ESCALATION PROTOCOL

### When to Flag Jesse
1. **Blocker**: Need decision/secret/permission only Jesse can provide
2. **Critical Error**: Something broke production or mission-critical
3. **Strategic Question**: Decision impacts race strategy
4. **Resource Need**: Budget, access, or tool required

### When NOT to Flag Jesse
1. **Tactical Decisions**: Within agent role authority
2. **Execution Details**: How to implement (just do it)
3. **Minor Issues**: Can be resolved at agent level
4. **Permission Seeking**: Default to action within bounds

## 📝 ERROR SUBMISSION FORMAT

### For Agents to Report Errors
```markdown
## Error Report

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
**Agent**: [Name + Emoji]
**Error Summary**: [One sentence]
**Details**: [What happened, what was expected]
**Impact**: [How it affected mission]
**Root Cause**: [Why it happened]
**Proposed Guarantee**: [What you commit to prevent recurrence]
**Verification**: [How CODEX can check compliance]
```

## 🏁 RACE DISCIPLINE

**Jesse's Standard**: "This is a RACE!!!"

**What That Means**:
- Speed matters (every hour counts)
- Errors cost position (must prevent recurrence)
- Accountability required (guarantees must be met)
- No excuses (execute or explain)
- Continuous improvement (each error = new guarantee)

**CODEX Role**:
- Track all errors (no hiding)
- Enforce all guarantees (no exceptions)
- Flag violations immediately (no delays)
- Hold team accountable (no favorites)
- Report to Jesse (full transparency)
