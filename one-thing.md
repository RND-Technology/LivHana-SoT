# One Thing Mission  
LivHana aims to unify Copilot, Claude CLI, and Codex CLI into a single integrated environment to accelerate development and ensure reproducible, context-aware code generation. This file describes the key strategic objective: to focus on one impactful improvement across the stack.  

- Consolidate environment using VS Code + Copilot Spaces.  
- Use Claude Code CLI for orchestrating multi-agent tasks and asynchronous jobs.  
- Use Codex CLI for repository surgery and configuration merges.  
- Provide guardrails and compliance via GPT-5 high-level QA.  

This file ensures Copilot and code agents know the primary mission when working within the repository.
