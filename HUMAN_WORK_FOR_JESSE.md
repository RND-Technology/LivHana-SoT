2. Go to: Settings → Integrations → Webhooks
3. Click "Add Webhook"

# If approved, run this command:
echo "APPROVED" > /Users/jesseniesen/LivHana-Trinity-Local/LivHana-SoT/DEPLOYMENT_APPROVED.txt

# Trinity will see this and execute deployments
```

**YOUR DECISION:**
- [ ] APPROVE - Deploy all services
- [ ] PARTIAL - Deploy only: _________________
