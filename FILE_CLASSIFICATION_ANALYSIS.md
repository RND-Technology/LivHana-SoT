## ‚úÖ RENAMING PLAN

### 1. Strategy Documents
```
FROM: RPM_DNA_FUSION_EMPIRE_E2E_FRAMEWORK.md
TO:   strategy_framework_rpm_dna_fusion_e2e.md
WHY:  Framework for E2E strategy
```

### 2. Engineering/Deployment Documents
```
FROM: EMPIRE_COCKPIT_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md
TO:   engineering_deployment_empire_cockpit_complete_20251002.md
WHY:  Engineering AOM, Deployment COI, Empire Cockpit RPM Block

FROM: empire_rpm_coi_cockpit_optimization_complete_20251002.md
TO:   engineering_optimization_empire_cockpit_complete_20251002.md
WHY:  Engineering AOM, Optimization COI (continuous improvement!)
```

### 3. Operations/Standards Documents
```
FROM: RPM_DNA_FILE_NAMING_SIMPLE.md
TO:   operations_standards_file_naming_system.md
WHY:  Operations AOM, Standards COI (establishing patterns)

FROM: RPM_DNA_FILE_NAMING_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md
TO:   operations_standards_file_naming_guide.md
WHY:  Operations AOM, Standards COI (comprehensive guide)
```

### 4. Operations/Documentation
```
FROM: SESSION_SUMMARY_RPM_DNA_FUSION.md
TO:   operations_documentation_session_summary_rpm_dna.md
WHY:  Operations AOM, Documentation COI
```

### 5. Operations/Tracking

## üèóÔ∏è EMPIRE-COCKPIT SUBDIRECTORY STRUCTURE

**Keep as-is** - Already well-organized by Next.js conventions:
- `src/lib/gamification.ts` ‚Üí Utilities (good)
- `src/lib/api-client.ts` ‚Üí Utilities (good)
- `src/components/DashboardTile.tsx` ‚Üí Components (good)
- `src/app/page.tsx` ‚Üí Pages (good)

**Why?** Standard Next.js structure is already optimal for engineering projects.

## üéØ GREP ENABLEMENT

After renaming, you can:

### Find all Strategy files
```bash
grep "strategy_" *.md
# ‚Üí All strategic framework documents
```

### Find all Engineering/Deployment files
```bash
grep "engineering_deployment" *.md
# ‚Üí All deployment-related engineering work
```

### Find all Engineering/Optimization files (COI!)
```bash
grep "engineering_optimization" *.md
# ‚Üí All continuous improvement in engineering
```

### Find all Operations/Standards files
```bash
grep "operations_standards" *.md
# ‚Üí All operational standards and conventions
```

### Create RPM Plan for Empire Cockpit
```bash
grep "empire_cockpit" *.md
# ‚Üí All files related to Empire Cockpit RPM block
```
