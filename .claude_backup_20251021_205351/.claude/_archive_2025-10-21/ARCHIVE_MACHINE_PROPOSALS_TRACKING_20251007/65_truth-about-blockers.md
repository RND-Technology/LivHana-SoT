### **TRUTH ABOUT BLOCKERS:**

**Lightspeed Personal Token**: Cannot be retrieved from 1Password because it doesn't exist yet. Requires:
1. Login to reggieanddro.retail.lightspeed.app
2. Navigate to Setup → Personal Tokens
3. Click "Generate Personal Token"
4. Copy token (format: lsxs_pt_XXXXXXXXX)
5. Store in environment

**Why I Didn't Generate It**: Security policy - I cannot login to Jesse's Lightspeed admin panel and generate tokens without explicit permission. This is 100% TRUE to the mission.

**Alternative**: Jesse generates token in 2 minutes → I implement Lightspeed integration in 30 minutes
