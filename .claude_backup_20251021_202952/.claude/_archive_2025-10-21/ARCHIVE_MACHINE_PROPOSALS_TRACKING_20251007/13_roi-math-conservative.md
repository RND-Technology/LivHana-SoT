### **ROI Math (Conservative)**:
Current reggieanddro.com (hypothetical):
- 1,000 visitors/month × 2% conversion = 20 orders × $75 = $1,500/month

After fixes (20% improvement):
- 1,000 visitors/month × 2.4% conversion = 24 orders × $75 = $1,800/month
- **+$300/month passive increase**
- **+$3,600/year from 3 days work**

VS building 23 new stores:
- Weeks of work, $0 until traffic proven, high risk
