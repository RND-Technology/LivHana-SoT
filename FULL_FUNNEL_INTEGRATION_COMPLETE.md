### **Customer Flow (10 Steps):**

```
1. Customer shops at reggieanddro.com
   ↓
2. Age verification (Jumio 21+ biometric IDV)
   ↓
3. First purchase complete (becomes VIP member)
   ↓
4. Liv Hana: "Hey [Name], congratulations on your first purchase! Want me to create a song just for you?"
   ↓
5. Customer says "Yes" → Suno AI generates personalized 30-second song (BPM/Key/Groove based on purchase)
   ↓
6. Customer listens → emotional reaction → "This is MY song!"
   ↓
7. Liv Hana: "You can co-own this song. 50% yours, 50% Reggie & Dro. You can earn royalties when others listen."
   ↓
8. One-click blockchain onboarding (KYC via Jumio - already verified)
   ↓
9. Smart contract mints song NFT (Solana/Polygon)
   → Customer owns 50%
   → R&D owns 50%
   → Distributed to Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube
   ↓
10. Customer dashboard shows:
    - Monthly royalty payments ($5-50/month passive income)
    - Total plays, total earnings
    - Next song creation (free monthly perk)
    - Share link to earn referral bonuses
```
