### **FINGER 1: RPM ALIGNMENT** âœ‹

**Question**: Are all Massive Actions aligned with Results & Purpose?

**Validation**:

- [ ] Every action directly contributes to stated results
- [ ] No conflicting priorities or resource allocation
- [ ] Clear metrics exist for success measurement

**Example**: If Result is "$100K monthly revenue recovery" but Massive Action is "build new product line," that's misalignment. Should be "fix Veriff integration, optimize conversion funnel."
