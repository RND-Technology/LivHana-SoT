### **FINGER 2: AOM MASTERY** ✋

**Question**: Do we have realistic progression paths (0 → NOW → NEXT → 10)?

**Validation**:

- [ ] Current level (NOW) honestly assessed, not aspirational
- [ ] NEXT level calculated: (10 - NOW) / 2 + NOW
- [ ] Improvement plans achievable in Q4 timeframe
- [ ] Critical capabilities covered

**Example**: If Leadership NOW = 6, then NEXT = (10-6)/2 + 6 = 8. Can you realistically achieve Level 8 leadership this quarter?
