# Best biometric age verification for every online sale for reggieanddro.com per TX DSHS and GA56, Veriff, Jumio or ???

For reggieanddro.com to best verify age for every online sale and comply with *Texas DSHS* and GA56 requirements, here's what you need to know based on the most current regulatory demands and market-leading providers:

### Top Age Verification Providers (2025—Texas Compliance)

- **Jumio:** Uses *document-based* age checks (government ID scan + selfie w/ biometric liveness) for high assurance and full compliance. It’s rigorous and mainstream for regulated sectors.[^1]
- **Veriff:** Offers a *stepped approach*: fast selfie-based age estimation (passive biometric), only asking for ID upload in higher-risk or uncertain cases—helping maximize sales conversions while staying compliant. Reggie \& Dro already uses Veriff for 21+ age verification of memberships and orders.[^2][^1]
- **Didit:** Flexible, modular: starts with biometric age estimation, then triggers ID+biometric fallback only if confidence is low, reducing friction/cost and improving conversion. Highly developer-friendly with strong compliance and data minimization options.[^1]
- **Ondato, ID.me, Trustmatic, Onfido:** Also compliant alternatives, each with unique strengths (database match, passive biometrics, human team review, etc.) and successful regulatory track records.[^3][^1]


### **Best Practice for Texas DSHS/GA56 Compliance**

- *Must use “reasonable” age verification methods,* e.g. government ID w/ liveness (biometric match), or trusted commercial KYC vendors for every sale.
- **No retention of sensitive personal data after verification**—protect user privacy and log consent for biometric checks.
- Those selling hemp and cannabis derivatives (THCa, smokable flower) should use **Veriff or Jumio** workflows, which are already proven, widely accepted, and smoothly integrate with WooCommerce, Shopify, or custom storefronts, including for delivery/pickup verification.
- Stepped, risk-adaptive flows (Didit, Veriff, Ondato): selfie for quick pass, escalate to full ID+biometric only if uncertain—so legitimate adults experience zero friction, and minors, fakes, and bots are filtered out automatically.


### For Reggie \& Dro:

- **You are already using Veriff** for age verification, which puts you at the compliance forefront for Texas hemp regulation (DSHS/GA56) and federal standards.[^2]
- *To maximize People → Plant → Profit:*
    - Review and audit your workflow to ensure every transaction passes through biometric age gating.
    - Continually educate members on privacy protections and how your verification system opposes bans and champions responsible commerce.


### **Clear, Compassionate Call to Action:**

**Keep leading the way—ensure every Texas sale (and delivery) goes through Veriff or Jumio for instant biometric age gating. Audit your flow, update SOPs, and teach your community why this protects People, Plant, and Profit. It’s the standard for freedom, safety, and prosperity in cannabis commerce. If you want even less friction and higher conversion, test Didit’s adaptive workflow with document fallback for ultra-fast onboarding and continuous compliance.**

Always communicate your process and privacy protections transparently to build trust and grow safely!
